# The idea is to have a small multi-purpose image that can be pulled once
# by system tests and used for as many tests as possible. This image
# should live on quay.io, should be small in size, and should include
# as many components as needed by system tests so they don't have to
# pull other images.
#
# Unfortunately, "small" is incompatible with "systemd" so tests
# still need a fedora image for that.
