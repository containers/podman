# These are the hand-maintained exceptions. This is what you want to edit
# or update as needed.
#
# There are three directives you can use below:
#
#    errmsg "old-message" "new-message" "test name" ["test name"...]
#
# This replaced "old-message" with "new-message" in @test "test name".
# It is used when a podman error message differs from buildah's.
#
#    [skip | skip_if_remote] "reason" "test name" ["test name"...]
#
# This adds a 'skip' statement as the first line of @test "test name".
# It is used when a test does not work in podman, either for permanent
# design-related reasons or for hopefully-temporary bug-in-podman reasons.
# (If the latter, please file an issue before adding the skip, and include
# the issue number in your skip message. This makes it possible to remove
# the skip once the issue is fixed).
#
# For both cases, you can list multiple "test names" at the end. This
# is not used much right now, but will be once I file my podman-remote PR
# because there are some cases where the same issue affects up to fifty
# different bud.bats tests.
