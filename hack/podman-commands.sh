**************************
** INTERPRETING RESULTS **
**************************************************************************
*
* The above results show differences between 'podman --help' and
* podman man pages.
*
* The 'checking:' header indicates the specific command (and possibly
* subcommand) being tested, e.g. podman --help vs docs/source/podman.1.md.
*
* A '-' indicates a subcommand present in 'podman --help' but not the
* corresponding man page.
*
* A '+' indicates a subcommand present in the man page but not --help.
