      # buildah-tests.diff is generated by 'git format-patch' and includes
      # trailing whitespace as part of its format. We can work around that,
      # but unfortunately the buildah repo has some files with tabs, which
      # git-diff formats as '[+/-]<space><tab>', which these hooks choke on.
      # Just disable checks on this diff file as a special case.
