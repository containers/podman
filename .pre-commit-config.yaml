      # `buildah-tests.diff` is generated by 'git format-patch' and includes
      # trailing whitespace as part of its format. We can work around that,
      # but unfortunately the buildah repo has some files with tabs, which
      # git-diff formats as '[+/-]<space><tab>', which these hooks choke on.
      # `contrib/systemd/user` and `test/python/requirements.txt` are symlinks
      # but for some reason, on windows, pre-commit consider it as a regular
      # file and tries to fix it. Just disable checks on these files as a
      # special case.
