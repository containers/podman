I'm sorry. The playbooks here are a much-too-complicated way of saying:

   - test podman (root and rootless)
   - same, with podman-remote

The starting point is tests.yml . From there:

    tests.yml
      \- test_podman.yml
           |- roles/rootless_user_ready/
           \- run_podman_tests.yml          (once for local, once for remote)
                \- roles/run_bats_tests/    (runs tests: root, rootless)

Principal result is the file 'artifacts/test.log'. It will contain
one line for each test run, format will be '(PASS|FAIL|ERROR) <test name>'

For each completed test there will also be a 'test.<name>.bats.log'
containing some setup blurbs (RPMs, environment) and the full BATS log.
