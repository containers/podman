#     should probably figure out how to fix systemd-resolved, then
#     remove this workaround.
#
#   * If we're STILL seeing the cdn03 flake, well, this "fix"
#     didn't work and should be removed.
#
# Either way, this block of code should be removed after March 31 2023
# because it creates a system that is not representative of real-world Fedora.
#
# 2024-01-25 update: ha ha. This fix has proven so popular that it is
# being used by other groups who were seeing the cdn03 flake. Looks like
