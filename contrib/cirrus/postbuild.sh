# This script attempts to confirm all included go modules from
# other sources match what is expected in `vendor/modules.txt`
# vs `go.mod`.  Also make sure that the generated bindings in
# `pkg/bindings/...` are in sync with the code.  It's intended
# for use after successfully building podman, to prevent wasting
# time on tests that might otherwise succeed with bad/ugly/invalid
# code.
