The following is a list (incomplete) of the primary contexts and runtime
"modes" supported by podman CI.  Note that there may be additional checks
done regarding "skipping work" in the `runner.sh` script.  This document
only details the controls at the `.cirrus.yml` level.

## Visualization

The relationship between tasks can be incredibly hard to understand by
staring at the YAML.
[A tool exists](https://github.com/containers/automation/tree/main/cirrus-task-map)
for producing a graph (flow-chart) of the `.cirrus.yml` file.  A (possibly
outdated) example of it's output can be seen below:

![cirrus-task-map output](https://github.com/containers/podman/wiki/cirrus-map.svg)

## Implementation notes

+ The `skip` conditional should never be used for tasks.
  While it's arguably easier to read that `only_if`, it leads to a cluttered
  status output that's harder to page through when reviewing PRs.  As opposed
  to `only_if` which will bypass creation of the task (at runtime) completely.
  Also, by sticking to one conditional style, it's easer to re-use the YAML
  statements across multiple tasks.

+ The only variables which can be used as part of conditions are defined by
  Cirrus-CI.
  [The list is documented](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/writing-tasks/#environment-variables).  Reference to any variables defined in YAML will **not** behave how
  you expect, don't use them!

* Some Cirrus-CI defined variables contain non-empty values outside their
  obvious context. For example, when running for a PR a task will have
  `$CIRRUS_BRANCH` set to `pull/<number>`.

* Conditions which use positive or negative regular-expressions have several
  "flags" set: "Multi-line" and "Case-insensitive".

## Testing

Executing most of the modes can be mocked by forcing values for (otherwise)
Cirrus-CI defined variables.  For example `$CIRRUS_TAG`.  As of the publishing
of this document, it's not possible to override the behavior of `$CIRRUS_PR`.
