# This service runs once each boot to remove potential leftover
# container state from previous boots.

# This is needed when using transient storage mode in podman where the
# database and other configs are stored in tmpfs, but some other files
# are not. If we don't run this after an unclean boot then there may
# be some leftover files that grow over time.
