# Change Request

## **Short Summary**

Introduce a type which wraps a trusted root directory and offers methods that confine operations within that root.

## **Objective**

Many paths in the codebase should be interpreted within a given root, rather than in the whole filesystem. Currently, there is no unified approach to ensure this happens, and overlooking the risk may introduce path traversal vulnerabilities. A common case is the use of purely lexical joining with `filepath.Join`, as seen in [CVE-2026-55686](https://github.com/podman-container-tools/podman/security/advisories/GHSA-q6r4-3wmg-fwcq) and [CVE-2025-9566](https://github.com/podman-container-tools/podman/security/advisories/GHSA-wp3j-xq48-xpjw).

There are known solutions, such as [securejoin.SecureJoin](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin#SecureJoin), [pathrs-lite.OpenInRoot](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/pathrs-lite#OpenInRoot), [os.Root](https://pkg.go.dev/os#Root). Additionally, operations can be implemented manually with syscalls like `openat2`, for example [chunked in c/storage](https://github.com/podman-container-tools/container-libs/blob/fa0afc2957aace7e00cece1a2fe90544a467a8cb/storage/pkg/chunked/filesystem_linux.go#L351). However, it is left to the contributor to evaluate whether the risk is there, and then to reach for the right mechanism. This proposal aims to leverage the type system to sustainably shift this dynamic: path confinement becomes the default, and bypassing it becomes a deliberate, visible choice.

## **Detailed Description:**

### **The basic idea**

#### String inside

Roots in the codebase are almost exclusively represented as strings. Keeping the inner representation makes the migration **incremental** and **compiler-guided**:

- **Incremental** - It is not necessary to rework the logic of the migrated site beforehand. The root (e.g. in a struct field) can be retyped, and during the migration, the surrounding code that does not yet use the type keeps working through the underlying string. The switch to `PathRoot` can therefore happen at an arbitrary layer, which also gives us the flexibility to keep a stable API where desirable.

- **Compiler-guided** - Once the root is retyped, the previous string operations on it (such as `filepath.Join(root, ...)`) stop compiling. The compiler errors mark every place that needs attention, so no usage is forgotten. After migration, this also guides the contributors to pick the secure operations on roots.

```go
type PathRoot struct {
	path string
}
```

The type is named `PathRoot` to:

- Make it instantly visible that it carries a path.
- Avoid confusion with `os.Root`.
- Distinguish it from another root type that could be part of the library.

The field `path` is unexported to avoid trivial protection bypasses.

#### Constructor

```go
func NewPathRoot(path string) (PathRoot, error) {
	if path == "" {
		return PathRoot{}, errors.New("root path cannot be empty")
	}
	return PathRoot{path: path}, nil
}
```

It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the root path is trusted. The constructor performs basic validation (rejecting empty strings) and could be extended with additional verification/preprocessing. There could be more constructors to cover different needs.

The constructor returns a value type, and unlike some current code that uses `""` as a placeholder, constructed `PathRoot` always expresses a root. When optionality is desirable, `*PathRoot` with `nil` for absence is the right representation.

An uninitialized value of `PathRoot{path: ""}` is not valid, constructor returns an error on this value, and to prevent accidental use, methods panic when called on uninitialized `PathRoot`.

#### Joining

```go
func (pr *PathRoot) Join(untrustedPath string) (string, error) {
	return securejoin.SecureJoin(pr.path, untrustedPath)
}
```

The general, cross-platform way to join an untrusted path onto the root, implemented by [`securejoin.SecureJoin`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin#SecureJoin). It protects against non-TOCTOU (static) path traversal, but it is not TOCTOU-safe. Where a TOCTOU-safe variant exists it is generally preferred (primarily for security, possibly also for performance). `Join` is a reasonable middle ground for spots that have no TOCTOU-safe variant, or where migrating to one is deferred.

#### Getting the string

```go
func (pr *PathRoot) PathWithoutProtection() string {
	return pr.path
}
```

Returns the underlying string, for use cases that the rest of the library cannot handle. It deliberately has a long, discouraging name, so that contributors consider the alternatives before calling it and so that it stands out in code review. Every call is easily searchable, so the bypasses can be audited or checked for in CI.

#### Logging

```go
func (pr *PathRoot) Format(f fmt.State, verb rune) {
	fmt.Fprintf(f, fmt.FormatString(f, verb), pr.path)
}
```

The `Stringer` interface is not implemented because it would introduce a less visible alternative to `PathWithoutProtection`. To support format strings (e.g. for logging), `Formatter` is implemented instead. `Format` does not return the string, and `path := fmt.Sprintf("%s", root)` is less legitimate-looking than `path := root.String()`.

### **TOCTOU-safe extensions**

#### Limitations of string joining

The `Join` method defined above returns a resolved string. Between resolution and usage, the state of the filesystem may change, and if that happens, the joined path may no longer be confined. These are TOCTOU (time-of-check to time-of-use) vulnerabilities, and eliminating them requires support from the operating system to make resolution and the operation happen atomically.

#### No universal counterpart

Whereas static path traversal can be mitigated universally and cross-platform through the string-based `Join`, there is no single TOCTOU-safe implementation that covers the use cases in the codebase:

- [os.Root](https://pkg.go.dev/os#Root) has the `RESOLVE_BENEATH` semantic, which rejects symlinks pointing outside the root, while for containers, the usual intent is `RESOLVE_IN_ROOT`, which re-roots such symlinks against the given root rather than the global `/`.
- [pathrs-lite.OpenInRoot](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/pathrs-lite#OpenInRoot) and `openat2` provide the desired resolution type, but are Linux-specific, which implies a trade-off. Either use them only in Linux-specific code, or accept lower security guarantees on other platforms.

Operating on file descriptors also introduces the overhead of managing their life cycles, regardless of the underlying implementation. And a file descriptor is ephemeral, process-local state, whereas roots can be serialized and persisted.

With these drawbacks in mind, an fd-only approach is limited to the sites where a suitable fd-based implementation is available. It risks leaving the easier-to-exploit static traversal cases unprotected while the harder cases are addressed, and still relies on a string wherever the fd-based alternative is not feasible. Establishing the string baseline first gives static-traversal safety at a lower migration cost. From there, TOCTOU safety can be adopted incrementally, driven by prioritization and by which operations each platform supports.

#### Placement of TOCTOU-safe methods

##### a) On `PathRoot` directly

For cases where only a single call is needed.

```go
func (pr *PathRoot) OpenFile(unsafePath string, mode os.FileMode) (*os.File, error) {
	...
}
```

##### b) On a separate type constructed from `PathRoot`

For cases where the operations are used multiple times, so that they can share one open.

```go
func (pr *PathRoot) OpenContainerRoot() (*ContainerRoot, error) {
	...
	return &ContainerRoot{file: file}, nil
}

type ContainerRoot struct {
	file *os.File
}

func (cr *ContainerRoot) OpenFile(unsafePath string, mode os.FileMode) (*os.File, error) {
	...
}

func (cr *ContainerRoot) Close() error {
	return cr.file.Close()
}
```

#### Duality of security guarantees

Once a TOCTOU-safe operation is supported on a platform, restricting its use to the code specific to that platform would needlessly limit the reach of the security improvement, while exposing it everywhere through a single method that silently falls back to `SecureJoin` would make it unclear whether TOCTOU safety holds for a given site.

The proposed solution is two explicitly named variants of each operation. The strict variant, suffixed `Concurrent`, guarantees TOCTOU safety and does not compile on unsupported platforms. The loose variant, suffixed `Racy`, is used where TOCTOU safety is not critical but still beneficial, and its implementation falls back to the string-based approach.

```go
// Only for linux
func (pr *PathRoot) OpenFileConcurrent(unsafePath string, mode os.FileMode) (*os.File, error) {
	...
}

// For all platforms
func (pr *PathRoot) OpenFileRacy(unsafePath string, mode os.FileMode) (*os.File, error) {
	if linux {
		return pr.OpenFileConcurrent(unsafePath, mode)
	} else {
		path, err := pr.Join(unsafePath)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		...
	}
}
```

#### Implementation used in methods

This is left open. A method can be backed by an external library (e.g. `pathrs-lite`) or self-implemented as in [chunked in c/storage](https://github.com/podman-container-tools/container-libs/blob/fa0afc2957aace7e00cece1a2fe90544a467a8cb/storage/pkg/chunked/filesystem_linux.go#L351).

### **Logistics**

#### Proposed first steps

- Migration of one root to make it static path traversal safe. In the [proof of concept](https://github.com/podman-container-tools/podman/pull/29871), this is [Mountpoint in libpod](https://github.com/podman-container-tools/podman/blob/1246f0ab8e8f627fbc27790ba648d5aea614b36c/libpod/container.go#L144), but it can be a different one.
- Moving the `Join` calls closer to the usage of their values, selecting a few TOCTOU-safe methods to support, and using them instead of the joined strings.
- Continuing in whichever direction provides the most value.

#### Marking the state of migration

The migration cannot happen all at once, so the new type meets the rest of the codebase along a frontier that moves as the work proceeds. The library uses a method-name suffix to mark this:

- **No suffix** - An evaluated, security-aware decision to use this operation.
- **`Deferred` suffix** - A compatibility layer between migrated and unmigrated code, intentionally left for a future migration step.

#### Placement of the library

Initially, the library with the type can reside in the codebase of the first migration, so that changes can be applied to it directly without cross-repository coordination. Later on, it should move somewhere it can be reused across the project, probably to `c/storage`. The library will be deliberately marked as unstable, so that modifications can happen easily without worrying about backwards-compatibility.

## **Use cases**

The type(s) can be applied to struct fields, variables, and function signatures that represent roots which other paths should be confined against (e.g. [Mountpoint in libpod](https://github.com/podman-container-tools/podman/blob/1246f0ab8e8f627fbc27790ba648d5aea614b36c/libpod/container.go#L144)).

## **Target Podman Release**

The scope is large and this is incremental effort, so the adoption can span multiple releases, not one in particular.

In terms of deadlines, I intend to actively work on this until around mid-December 2026.

Thanks to @mtrmac, @Luap99, @mheon, @TomSweeneyRedHat, and @giuseppe for the discussions and feedback that shaped this design before it was proposed upstream.

## **Impacts**

There shouldn't be externally visible changes for legitimate use cases, only the prevention of escapes from the root. During the migration the codebase is temporarily inconsistent, with some call sites using the type and others still passing raw strings, and the changes can cause merge conflicts with concurrent work.

## **Further Description (Optional):**

Naming throughout this document is open to discussion.

## **Test Descriptions (Optional):**

Most of the library wraps external functions that are tested by their own projects and already trusted in the codebase, so the library builds on their existing coverage. Where an operation is implemented directly instead of delegated, it gets covered by its own tests.

Regressions are caught by the existing test suite, including the tests for previously fixed vulnerabilities. If a new vulnerability is discovered, a test for it can be added along with the fix.
