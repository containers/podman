# libpod Installation Instructions

The installation instructions for Podman and libpod now reside **[here](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)** in the **[podman.io](https://podman.io)** site.  From the hompage, the installation instructions can be found under "Get Started->Installing Podman".

The podman.io site resides in a GitHub under the Containers repository at [https://github.com/containers/podman.io](https://github.com/containers/podman.io).  If you see a change that needs to happen to the installation instructions, please feel free to open a pull request there, we're always happy to have new contributors!
