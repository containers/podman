      as possible from the spec and container config.
      Some things cannot be inferred. These will be populated by spec annotations

          though it is guaranteed that the device node will be the same, and

    This documentation describes the HTTP Libpod interface.  It is to be considered
    only as experimental as this point.  The endpoints, parameters, inputs, and
    return values can all change.

    To start the service and keep it running for 5,000 seconds (-t 0 runs forever):

    podman system service -t 5000 &

    You can then use cURL on the socket using requests documented below.

    NOTE: if you install the package podman-docker, it will create a symbolic
    link for /var/run/docker.sock to /run/podman/podman.sock

    See podman-service(1) for more information.

    Quick Examples:

    'podman info'

    curl --unix-socket /run/podman/podman.sock http://d/v1.0.0/libpod/info

    'podman pull quay.io/containers/podman'

    curl -XPOST --unix-socket /run/podman/podman.sock -v 'http://d/v1.0.0/images/create?fromImage=quay.io%2Fcontainers%2Fpodman'

    'podman list images'

    curl --unix-socket /run/podman/podman.sock -v 'http://d/v1.0.0/libpod/images/json' | jq

            Network is primarily keyed based on a random ID and not on the name.
            Network name is strictly a user-friendly alias to the network
            which is uniquely identified using ID.
            And there is no guaranteed way to check for duplicates.
            Option CheckDuplicate is there to provide a best effort checking of any networks
            which has the same name but it is not guaranteed to catch all name collisions.
