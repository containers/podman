## NAME
podman\-pod\-logs - Display logs for pod with one or more containers

## SYNOPSIS
**podman pod logs** [*options*] *pod*

## DESCRIPTION
The podman pod logs command batch-retrieves whatever logs are present with all the containers of a pod. Pod logs can be filtered by container name or ID using flag **-c** or **--container** if needed.

Note: A long-running `podman pod log` command with a `-f` or `--follow` option needs to be reinvoked if a new container is added to the pod dynamically; otherwise, logs of newly added containers are not visible in the log stream.

## OPTIONS

@@option color

#### **--container**, **-c**

By default, `podman pod logs` retrieves logs for all the containers available within the pod, differentiated by the field `container`. However, there are use cases where the user wants to limit the log stream only to a particular container of a pod. For such cases, `-c` can be used like `podman pod logs -c ctrNameorID podname`.

@@option latest

@@option names

@@option since
