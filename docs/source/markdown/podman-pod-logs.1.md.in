## NAME
podman\-pod\-logs - Displays logs for pod with one or more containers

## SYNOPSIS
**podman pod logs** [*options*] *pod*

## DESCRIPTION
The podman pod logs command batch-retrieves whatever logs are present with all the containers of a pod. Pod logs can be filtered by container name or id using flag **-c** or **--container** if needed.

Note: Long running command of `podman pod log` with a `-f` or `--follow` needs to be reinvoked if new container is added to the pod dynamically otherwise logs of newly added containers would not be visible in log stream.

## OPTIONS

@@option color

#### **--container**, **-c**

By default `podman pod logs` retrieves logs for all the containers available within the pod differentiate by field `container`. However there are use-cases where user would want to limit the log stream only to a particular container of a pod for such cases `-c` can be used like `podman pod logs -c ctrNameorID podname`.

@@option follow

#### **--latest**, **-l**

Instead of providing the pod name or id, get logs of the last created pod. (This option is not available with the remote Podman client, including Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

#### **--names**, **-n**

Output the container names instead of the container IDs in the log.

@@option since

@@option tail

@@option timestamps
