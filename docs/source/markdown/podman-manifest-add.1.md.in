## NAME
podman\-manifest\-add - Add an image or artifact to a manifest list or image index

## SYNOPSIS
**podman manifest add** [*options*] *listnameorindexname* [*transport*]:*imagename* *imageorartifactname* [...]

## DESCRIPTION

Adds the specified image to the specified manifest list or image index, or
creates an artifact manifest and adds it to the specified image index.

## RETURN VALUE

The list image's ID.

## OPTIONS

#### **--all**

If the image which is added to the list or index is itself a list or
index, add all of the contents to the local list.  By default, only one image
from such a list or index is added to the list or index.  Combining
*--all* with any of the other options described below is NOT recommended.

@@option annotation.manifest

#### **--arch**=*architecture*

Override the architecture which the list or index records as a requirement for
the image.  If *imageName* refers to a manifest list or image index, the
architecture information is retrieved from it.  Otherwise, it is
retrieved from the image's configuration information.

#### **--artifact**

Create an artifact manifest and add it to the image index.  Arguments after the
index name will be interpreted as file names rather than as image references.
In most scenarios, the **--artifact-type** option should also be specified.

#### **--artifact-config**=*path*

When creating an artifact manifest and adding it to the image index, use the
specified file's contents as the configuration blob in the artifact manifest.
In most scenarios, leaving the default value, which signifies an empty
configuration, unchanged, is the preferred option.

#### **--artifact-config-type**=*type*

When creating an artifact manifest and adding it to the image index, use the
specified MIME type as the `mediaType` associated with the configuration blob
in the artifact manifest.  In most scenarios, leaving the default value, which
signifies either an empty configuration or the standard OCI configuration type,
unchanged, is the preferred option.

#### **--artifact-exclude-titles**

When creating an artifact manifest and adding it to the image index, do not
set "org.opencontainers.image.title" annotations equal to the file's basename
for each file added to the artifact manifest.  Tools which retrieve artifacts
from a registry may use these values to choose names for files when saving
artifacts to disk, so this option is not recommended unless it is required
for interoperability with a particular registry.

#### **--artifact-layer-type**=*type*

When creating an artifact manifest and adding it to the image index, use the
specified MIME type as the `mediaType` associated with the files' contents.  If
not specified, guesses based on either the files names or their contents will
be made and used, but the option should be specified if certainty is needed.

#### **--artifact-subject**=*imageName*

When creating an artifact manifest and adding it to the image index, set the
*subject* field in the artifact manifest to mark the artifact manifest as being
associated with the specified image in some way.  An artifact manifest can only
be associated with, at most, one subject.

#### **--artifact-type**=*type*

When creating an artifact manifest, use the specified MIME type as the
manifest's `artifactType` value instead of the less informative default value.

@@option features

#### **--os**=*OS*

Override the OS which the list or index records as a requirement for the image.
If *imagename* refers to a manifest list or image index, the OS information
is retrieved from it.  Otherwise, it is retrieved from the image's
configuration information.

## Transport

 Multiple transports are supported:

  **docker://**_docker-reference_ _(default)_
  An image in a registry implementing the "Docker Registry HTTP API V2". By default, uses the authorization state in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json`, which is set using `(podman login)`. If the authorization state is not found there, `$HOME/.docker/config.json` is checked, which is set using `(docker login)`.

    $ podman manifest add mylist:v1.11 docker://quay.io/username/myimage

  **containers-storage:**_oci-reference_
  An image in _oci-reference_ format stored in the local container storage. _oci-reference_ must contain a tag.

    $ podman manifest add mylist:v1.11 containers-storage:quay.io/username/myimage

  **dir:**_path_
  An existing local directory _path_ storing the manifest, layer tarballs, and signatures as individual files. This
  is a non-standardized format, primarily useful for debugging or noninvasive container inspection.

    $ podman manifest add dir:/tmp/myimage

  **docker-archive:**_path_[**:**_docker-reference_]
  An image is stored in the `docker save` formatted file.  _docker-reference_ is only used when creating such a
  file, and it must not contain a digest.

    $ podman manifest add docker-archive:/tmp/myimage

  **docker-daemon:**_docker-reference_
  An image in _docker-reference_ format stored in the docker daemon internal storage. The _docker-reference_ can also be an image ID (docker-daemon:algo:digest).

    $ sudo podman manifest add docker-daemon:docker.io/library/myimage:33

  **oci-archive:**_path_**:**_tag_
  An image _tag_ in a directory compliant with "Open Container Image Layout Specification" at _path_.

    $ podman manifest add oci-archive:/tmp/myimage

## EXAMPLE

Add specified default image from source manifest list to destination manifest list:
```
podman manifest add mylist:v1.11 docker://fedora
71c201d10fffdcac52968a000d85a0a016ca1c7d5473948000d3131c1773d965
```

Add all images from source manifest list to destination manifest list:
```
podman manifest add --all mylist:v1.11 docker://fedora
71c201d10fffdcac52968a000d85a0a016ca1c7d5473948000d3131c1773d965
```

Add selected image matching arch and variant from source manifest list to destination manifest list:
```
podman manifest add --arch arm64 --variant v8 mylist:v1.11 docker://71c201d10fffdcac52968a000d85a0a016ca1c7d5473948000d3131c1773d965
```
