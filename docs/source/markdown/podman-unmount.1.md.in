## NAME
podman\-unmount - Unmount a working container's root filesystem

## SYNOPSIS
**podman unmount** [*options*] *container* [...]

**podman umount** [*options*] *container* [...]

**podman container unmount** [*options*] *container* [...]

**podman container umount** [*options*] *container* [...]

## DESCRIPTION
Unmounts the specified containers' root file system, if no other processes
are using it.

Container storage increments a mount counter each time a container is mounted.
When a container is unmounted, the mount counter is decremented, and the
container's root filesystem is physically unmounted only when the mount
counter reaches zero indicating no other processes are using the mount.
An unmount can be forced with the --force flag.

Note: Podman can be used to unmount Podman containers as well as external containers.
External containers are containers created in container/storage by other tools like
Buildah and CRI-O.

## OPTIONS
#### **--all**, **-a**

All of the currently mounted containers are unmounted.

#### **--force**, **-f**

Force the unmounting of specified containers' root file system, even if other
processes have mounted it.

Note: Other processes can fail if the mount point they are using is removed without their knowledge.
