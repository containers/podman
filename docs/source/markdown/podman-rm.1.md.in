## NAME
podman\-rm - Remove one or more containers

## SYNOPSIS
**podman rm** [*options*] *container*

**podman container rm** [*options*] *container*

## DESCRIPTION
**podman rm** removes one or more containers from the host.  The container name or ID can be used.  This does not remove images.
Running or unusable containers are not removed without the **-f** option.

## OPTIONS

#### **--all**, **-a**

Remove all containers.  Can be used in conjunction with **-f** as well.

@@option cidfile.read

Command does not fail when *file* is missing and user specified --ignore.

#### **--depend**

Remove selected container and recursively remove all containers that depend on it.

#### **--filter**=*filter*

Filter what containers remove.
Multiple filters can be given with multiple uses of the --filter flag.
Filters with the same key work inclusive with the only exception being
`label` which is exclusive. Filters with different keys always work exclusive.

Valid filters are listed below:

| network    | [Network] name or full ID of network                                                            |
| until      | [DateTime] Containers created before the given duration or time.                                |

#### **--force**, **-f**

Force the removal of running and paused containers. Forcing a container removal also
removes containers from container storage even if the container is not known to Podman.
For example, containers that are created by different container engines like Buildah.
In addition, forcing can be used to remove unusable containers, e.g. containers
whose OCI runtime has become unavailable.

@@option ignore
Further ignore when the specified `--cidfile` does not exist as it may have
already been removed along with the container.

@@option latest

@@option time

The --force option must be specified to use the --time option.

#### **--volumes**, **-v**

Remove anonymous volumes associated with the container. This does not include named volumes
created with **podman volume create**, or the **--volume** option of **podman run** and **podman create**.

## EXAMPLE
Remove container with a given name:
```
$ podman rm mywebserver
```

Remove container with a given name and all of the containers that depend on it:
```
$ podman rm --depend mywebserver
```

Remove multiple containers with given names or IDs:
```
$ podman rm mywebserver myflaskserver 860a4b23
```

Remove multiple containers with IDs read from files:
```
$ podman rm --cidfile ./cidfile-1 --cidfile /home/user/cidfile-2
```

Forcibly remove container with a given ID:
```
$ podman rm -f 860a4b23
```

Remove all containers regardless of the run state:
```
$ podman rm -f -a
```

Forcibly remove the last created container. (This option is not available with the remote Podman client, including Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines):
```
$ podman rm -f --latest
```

## Exit Status
  **0**   All specified containers removed

  **1**   One of the specified containers did not exist, and no other failures

  **2**   One of the specified containers is paused or running

  **125** The command fails for any other reason
