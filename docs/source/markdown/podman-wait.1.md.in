## NAME
podman\-wait - Wait on one or more containers to stop and print their exit codes

## SYNOPSIS
**podman wait** [*options*] *container* [...]

**podman container wait** [*options*] *container* [...]

## DESCRIPTION
Waits on one or more containers to stop.  The container can be referred to by its
name or ID.  In the case of multiple containers, Podman waits on each consecutively.
After all conditions are satisfied, the containers' return codes are printed
separated by newline in the same order as they were given to the command.  An
exit code of -1 is emitted for all conditions other than "stopped" and
"exited".

When waiting for containers with a restart policy of `always` or `on-failure`,
such as those created by `podman kube play`, the containers may be repeatedly
exiting and restarting, possibly with different exit codes. `podman wait` will
only display and detect the first exit after the wait command was started.

When running a container with podman run --rm wait does not wait for the
container to be fully removed. To wait for the removal of a container use
`--condition=removing`.

## OPTIONS

#### **--condition**=*state*
Container state or condition to wait for.  Can be specified multiple times where at least one condition must match for the command to return.  Supported values are "configured", "created", "exited", "healthy", "initialized", "paused", "removing", "running", "stopped",  "stopping", "unhealthy".  The default condition is "stopped".

#### **--help**, **-h**

 Print usage statement


#### **--ignore**
Ignore errors when a specified container is missing and mark its return code as -1.

#### **--interval**, **-i**=*duration*
  Time interval to wait before polling for completion. A duration string is a sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". Time unit defaults to "ms".
