## NAME
podman\-wait - Wait on one or more containers to stop and print their exit codes

## SYNOPSIS
**podman wait** [*options*] *container* [...]

**podman container wait** [*options*] *container* [...]

## DESCRIPTION
Waits on one or more containers to stop.  The container can be referred to by its
name or ID.  In the case of multiple containers, Podman waits on each consecutively.
After all conditions are satisfied, the containers' return codes are printed
separated by newline in the same order as they were given to the command.  An
exit code of -1 is emitted for all conditions other than "stopped" and
"exited".

NOTE: there is an inherent race condition when waiting for containers with a
restart policy of `always` or `on-failure`, such as those created by `podman
kube play`. Such containers may be repeatedly exiting and restarting, possibly
with different exit codes, but `podman wait` can only display and detect one.

## OPTIONS

#### **--condition**=*state*
Container state or condition to wait for.  Can be specified multiple times where at least one condition must match for the command to return.  Supported values are "configured", "created", "exited", "healthy", "initialized", "paused", "removing", "running", "stopped",  "stopping", "unhealthy".  The default condition is "stopped".

#### **--help**, **-h**

 Print usage statement


#### **--ignore**
Ignore errors when a specified container is missing and mark its return code as -1.

#### **--interval**, **-i**=*duration*
  Time interval to wait before polling for completion. A duration string is a sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". Time unit defaults to "ms".
