#### **--health-startup-cmd**=*"command"* | *'["command", "arg1", ...]'*

Set a startup healthcheck command for a container. This command is executed inside the container and is used to gate the regular
healthcheck. When the startup command succeeds, the regular healthcheck begins and the startup healthcheck ceases. Optionally,
if the command fails for a set number of attempts, the container is restarted. A startup healthcheck can be used to ensure that
containers with an extended startup period are not marked as unhealthy until they are fully started. Startup healthchecks can only be
used when a regular healthcheck (from the container's image or the **--health-cmd** option) is also set.
