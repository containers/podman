#### **--health-start-period**=*period*

The initialization time needed for a container to bootstrap. The value can be expressed in time format like
**2m3s**. The default value is **0s**.

Note: The health check command is executed as soon as a container is started, if the health check is successful
the container's health state will be updated to `healthy`. However, if the health check fails, the health state will
stay as `starting` until either the health check is successful or until the `--health-start-period` time is over. If the
health check command fails after the `--health-start-period` time is over, the health state will be updated to `unhealthy`.
The health check command is executed periodically based on the value of `--health-interval`.
