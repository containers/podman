#### **--cpu-quota**=*limit*

Limit the CPU Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) quota.

Limit the container's CPU usage. By default, containers run with the full
CPU resource. The limit is a number in microseconds. If a number is provided,
the container is allowed to use that much CPU time until the CPU period
ends (controllable via **--cpu-period**).

On some systems, changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root
users. For more details, see
https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.
