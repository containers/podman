#### **--filter**, **-f**=*filter*

Filter what volumes are shown in the output.

The *filters* argument format is of `key=value`. If there is more than one *filter*, then pass multiple OPTIONS: **--filter** *foo=bar* **--filter** *bif=baz*.

Filters with the same key work inclusive, with the only exception being `label`
which is exclusive. Filters with different keys always work exclusive.

Volumes can be filtered by the following attributes:

| **Filter**  | **Description**                                                                       |
