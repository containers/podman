#### **--dns**=*ipaddr*

Set custom DNS servers.

This option can be used to override the DNS
configuration passed to the container. Typically this is necessary when the
host DNS configuration is invalid for the container (e.g., **127.0.0.1**). When this
is the case the **--dns** flag is necessary for every run.

The special value **none** can be specified to disable creation of _/etc/resolv.conf_ in the container by Podman.
The _/etc/resolv.conf_ file in the image will be used without changes.
