#### **--dns**=*ipaddr*

Set custom DNS servers. Invalid if using **--dns** with **--network** that is set to **none** or **container:**_id_.

This option can be used to override the DNS
configuration passed to the container. Typically this is necessary when the
host DNS configuration is invalid for the container (e.g., **127.0.0.1**). When this
is the case the **--dns** flag is necessary for every run.

The special value **none** can be specified to disable creation of _/etc/resolv.conf_ in the container by Podman.
The _/etc/resolv.conf_ file in the image will be used without changes.
