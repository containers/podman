Each *.json file in the path configures a hook for buildah build containers. For more details on the syntax of the JSON files and the semantics of hook injection. Buildah currently support both the 1.0.0 and 0.1.0 hook schemas, although the 0.1.0 schema is deprecated.

This option may be set multiple times; paths from later options have higher precedence.

For the annotation conditions, buildah uses any annotations set in the generated OCI configuration.

For the bind-mount conditions, only mounts explicitly requested by the caller via --volume are considered. Bind mounts that buildah inserts by default (e.g. /dev/shm) are not considered.

If --hooks-dir is unset for root callers, Buildah currently defaults to /usr/share/containers/oci/hooks.d and /etc/containers/oci/hooks.d in order of increasing precedence. Using these defaults is deprecated. Migrate to explicitly setting --hooks-dir.
