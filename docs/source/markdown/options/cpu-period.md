#### **--cpu-period**=*limit*

Set the CPU period for the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS), which is a
duration in microseconds. Once the container's CPU quota is used up, it will not
be scheduled to run until the current period ends. Defaults to 100000
microseconds.

On some systems, changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root
users. For more details, see
https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.
