#### **--memory-reservation**=*number[unit]*

Memory soft limit. A _unit_ can be **b** (bytes), **k** (kibibytes), **m** (mebibytes), or **g** (gibibytes).

After setting memory reservation, when the system detects memory contention
or low memory, containers are forced to restrict their consumption to their
reservation. So you should always set the value below **--memory**, otherwise the
hard limit will take precedence. By default, memory reservation will be the same
as memory limit.

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.
