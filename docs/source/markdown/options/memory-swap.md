#### **--memory-swap**=*number[unit]*

A limit value equal to memory plus swap.
A _unit_ can be **b** (bytes), **k** (kibibytes), **m** (mebibytes), or **g** (gibibytes).

Must be used with the **-m** (**--memory**) flag.
The argument value must be larger than that of
 **-m** (**--memory**) By default, it is set to double
the value of **--memory**.

Set _number_ to **-1** to enable unlimited swap.
