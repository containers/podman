Path of the authentication file. Default is `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json` on Linux, and `$HOME/.config/containers/auth.json` on Windows/macOS.
The file is created by **[podman login](podman-login.1.md)**. If the authorization state is not found there, `$HOME/.docker/config.json` is checked, which is set using **docker login**.

Note: There is also the option to override the default path of the authentication file by setting the `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable. This can be done with **export REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE=_path_**.
