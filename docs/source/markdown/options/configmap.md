Use Kubernetes configmap YAML at path to provide a source for environment variable values within the containers of the pod.  (This option is not available with the remote Podman client)

<< if is_quadlet >>
The value may contain only one path but it may be absolute or relative to the location of the unit file.
<< else >>
Note: The **--configmap** option can be used multiple times or a comma-separated list of paths can be used to pass multiple Kubernetes configmap YAMLs.
The YAML file may be in a multi-doc YAML format. But, it must contain only configmaps.
