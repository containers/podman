Set the ipam driver (IP Address Management Driver) for the network. When unset, Podman chooses an
ipam driver automatically based on the network driver.

Valid values are:

 - `dhcp`: IP addresses are assigned from a DHCP server on the network.
  The `netavark-dhcp-proxy.socket` unit must be enabled in order to start the DHCP proxy when a container is
  started.
 - `host-local`: IP addresses are assigned locally.
 - `none`: No ip addresses are assigned to the interfaces.

View the driver in the **podman network inspect** output under the `ipam_options` field.
