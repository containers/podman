#### **--cpuset-mems**=*nodes*

Memory nodes (MEMs) in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1). Only effective on
NUMA systems.

If there are four memory nodes on the system (0-3), use **--cpuset-mems=0,1**
then processes in the container will only use memory from the first
two memory nodes.

On some systems, changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root
users. For more details, see
https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.
