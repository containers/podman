#### **--gpus**=*ENTRY*

Start the container with GPU support. Where `ENTRY` can be `all` to request all GPUs, or a vendor-specific identifier. Currently NVIDIA and AMD devices are supported. If both NVIDIA and AMD devices are present the NVIDIA devices will be preferred and a CDI device name must be specified using the `--device` flag to request a set of GPUs from a *specific* vendor.
