#### **--gidmap**=*container_gid:host_gid:amount*

Run the container in a new user namespace using the supplied GID mapping. This
option conflicts with the **--userns** and **--subgidname** options. This
option provides a way to map host GIDs to container GIDs in the same way as
__--uidmap__ maps host UIDs to container UIDs. For details see __--uidmap__.

Note: the **--gidmap** flag cannot be called in conjunction with the **--pod** flag as a gidmap cannot be set on the container level when in a pod.
