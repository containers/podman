#### **--health-cmd**=*"command"* | *'["command", "arg1", ...]'*

Set or alter a healthcheck command for a container. The command is a command to be executed inside your
container that determines your container health. The command is required for other healthcheck options
to be applied. A value of **none** disables existing healthchecks.

Multiple options can be passed in the form of a JSON array; otherwise, the command will be interpreted
as an argument to `/bin/sh -c`.
