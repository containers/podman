## NAME
podman\-stop - Stop one or more running containers

## SYNOPSIS
**podman stop** [*options*] *container* ...

**podman container stop** [*options*] *container* ...

## DESCRIPTION
Stops one or more containers using container IDs or names as input. The **--time** option
specifies the number of seconds to wait before forcibly stopping the container after the stop command
is issued to the container. The default is 10 seconds. By default, containers are stopped with SIGTERM
and then SIGKILL after the timeout. The SIGTERM default can be overridden by the image used to create the
container and also via command line when creating the container.

## OPTIONS

#### **--all**, **-a**

Stop all running containers.  This does not include paused containers.

@@option cidfile.read

Command does not fail when *file* is missing and user specified --ignore.

#### **--filter**, **-f**=*filter*

Filter what containers are going to be stopped.
Multiple filters can be given with multiple uses of the --filter flag.
Filters with the same key work inclusive with the only exception being
`label` which is exclusive. Filters with different keys always work exclusive.

Valid filters are listed below:
