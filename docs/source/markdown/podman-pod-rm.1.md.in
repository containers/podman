## SYNOPSIS

## DESCRIPTION
**podman pod rm** will remove one or more stopped pods and their containers from the host.  The pod name or ID can be used. The \-f option stops all containers and then removes them before removing the pod. If all containers added by the user are in an exited state, the pod will be removed.

## OPTIONS

#### **--all**, **-a**

Remove all pods.  Can be used in conjunction with \-f as well.

#### **--force**, **-f**

Stop running containers and delete all stopped containers before removal of pod.

#### **--latest**, **-l**

Instead of providing the pod name or ID, remove the last created pod. (This option is not available with the remote Podman client, including Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

#### **--time**, **-t**=*seconds*

Seconds to wait before forcibly stopping running containers within the pod. The --force option must be specified to use the --time option.
