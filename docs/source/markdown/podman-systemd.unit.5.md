## NAME

podman\-systemd.unit - systemd units using Podman

## SYNOPSIS

*name*.container, *name*.volume

### Podman unit search path

 * /etc/containers/systemd/
 * /usr/share/containers/systemd/

### Podman user unit search path

 * $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/containers/systemd/
 * ~/.config/containers/systemd/

## DESCRIPTION

Podman supports starting containers (and creating volumes) via systemd by using a
[systemd generator](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.generator.html).
These files are read during boot (and when `systemctl daemon-reload` is run) and generate
corresponding regular systemd service unit files. Both system and user systemd units are supported.

The Podman generator reads the search paths above and reads files with the extensions `.container`
and `.volume`, and for each file generates a similarly named `.service` file. These units can be started
and managed with systemctl like any other systemd service.

The Podman files use the same format as [regular systemd unit files](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.syntax.html).
Each file type has a custom section (for example, `[Container]`) that is handled by Podman, and all
other sections will be passed on untouched, allowing the use of any normal systemd configuration options
like dependencies or cgroup limits.

### Enabling unit files

The services created by Podman are considered transient by systemd, which means they don't have the same
persistence rules as regular units. In particular, it is not possible to "systemctl enable" them
in order for them to become automatically enabled on the next boot.

To compensate for this, the generator manually applies the `[Install]` section of the container definition
unit files during generation, in the same way `systemctl enable` would do when run later.

For example, to start a container on boot, add something like this to the file:

```
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Currently, only the `Alias`, `WantedBy` and `RequiredBy` keys are supported.

**NOTE:** To express dependencies between containers, use the generated names of the service. In other
words `WantedBy=other.service`, not `WantedBy=other.container`. The same is
true for other kinds of dependencies, too, like `After=other.service`.

### Container units

Container units are named with a `.container` extension and contain a `[Container] `section describing
the container that should be run as a service. The resulting service file will contain a line like
`ExecStart=podman run â€¦ image-name`, and most of the keys in this section control the command-line
options passed to Podman. However, some options also affect the details of how systemd is set up to run and
interact with the container.

By default, the Podman container will have the same name as the unit, but with a `systemd-` prefix.
I.e. a `$name.container` file will create a `$name.service` unit and a `systemd-$name` Podman container.

There is only one required key, `Image`, which defines the container image the service should run.

Supported keys in `Container` section are:

#### `Image=`

The image to run in the container. This image must be locally installed for the service to work
when it is activated, because the generated service file will never try to download images.
It is recommended to use a fully qualified image name rather than a short name, both for
performance and robustness reasons.

The format of the name is the same as when passed to `podman run`, so it supports e.g., using
`:tag` or using digests guarantee a specific image version.

#### `ContainerName=`

The (optional) name of the Podman container. If this is not specified, the default value
of `systemd-%N` will be used, which is the same as the service name but with a `systemd-`
prefix to avoid conflicts with user-managed containers.

#### `Environment=`

Set an environment variable in the container. This uses the same format as
[services in systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#Environment=)
and can be listed multiple times.

#### `Exec=`

If this is set then it defines what command line to run in the container. If it is not set the
default entry point of the container image is used. The format is the same as for
[systemd command lines](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html#Command%20lines).

#### `User=`

The (numeric) uid to run as inside the container. This does not need to match the uid on the host,
which can be modified with `RemapUsers`, but if that is not specified, this uid is also used on the host.

#### `Group=`

The (numeric) gid to run as inside the container. This does not need to match the gid on the host,
which can be modified with `RemapUsers`, but if that is not specified, this gid is also used on the host.

#### `NoNewPrivileges=` (defaults to `no`)

If enabled (which is the default), this disables the container processes from gaining additional privileges via things like
setuid and file capabilities.

#### `DropCapability=` (defaults to `all`)

Drop these capabilities from the default podman capability set, or `all` to drop all capabilities.

This is a space separated list of capabilities. This key can be listed multiple times.

For example:
```
DropCapability=CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE CAP_IPC_OWNER
```

#### `AddCapability=`

By default, the container runs with no capabilities (due to DropCapabilities='all'). If any specific
caps are needed, then add them with this key. For example using `AddCapability=CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE`.

This is a space separated list of capabilities. This key can be listed multiple times.

For example:
```
AddCapability=CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE CAP_IPC_OWNER
```

#### `ReadOnly=` (defaults to `no`)

If enabled, makes image read-only, with /var/tmp, /tmp and /run a tmpfs (unless disabled by `VolatileTmp=no`).r

**NOTE:** Podman will automatically copy any content from the image onto the tmpfs

#### `SeccompProfile=`

Set the seccomp profile to use in the container. If unset, the default podman profile is used.
Set to either the pathname of a json file, or `unconfined` to disable the seccomp filters.

#### `RemapUsers=`

If this is set, then host user and group ids are remapped in the container. It currently
supports values: `auto`, `manual` and `keep-id`.

In `manual` mode, the `RemapUid` and `RemapGid` options can define an
exact mapping of uids from host to container. You must specify these.

In `auto` mode mode, the subuids and subgids allocated to the `containers` user is used to allocate
host uids/gids to use for the container. By default this will try to estimate a count of the ids
to remap, but RemapUidSize can be specified to use an explicit size. Use `RemapUid` and
`RemapGid` key to force a particular host uid to be mapped to the container.

In `keep-id` mode, the running user is mapped to the same id in the container. This is supported
only on user systemd units.

#### `RemapUid=`

If `RemapUsers` is enabled, this specifies a uid mapping of the form `container_uid:from_uid:amount`,
which will map `amount` number of uids on the host starting at `from_uid` into the container, starting
at `container_uid`.

#### `RemapGid=`

If `RemapUsers` is enabled, this specifies a gid mapping of the form `container_gid:from_gid:amount`,
which will map `amount` number of gids on the host starting at `from_gid` into the container, starting
at `container_gid`.

#### `Notify=` (defaults to `no`)

By default, Podman is run in such a way that the systemd startup notify command is handled by
the container runtime. In other words, the service is deemed started when the container runtime
starts the child in the container. However, if the container application supports
[sd_notify](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_notify.html), then setting
`Notify`to true will pass the notification details to the container allowing it to notify
of startup on its own.

#### `Timezone=` (if unset uses system-configured default)

The timezone to run the container in.

#### `RunInit=` (default to `no`)

If enabled, the container will have a minimal init process inside the
container that forwards signals and reaps processes.

#### `VolatileTmp=` (default to `no`, or `yes` if `ReadOnly` enabled)

If enabled, the container will have a fresh tmpfs mounted on `/tmp`.

**NOTE:** Podman will automatically copy any content from the image onto the tmpfs

#### `Volume=`

Mount a volume in the container. This is equivalent to the Podman `--volume` option, and
generally has the form `[[SOURCE-VOLUME|HOST-DIR:]CONTAINER-DIR[:OPTIONS]]`.

As a special case, if `SOURCE-VOLUME` ends with `.volume`, a Podman named volume called
`systemd-$name` will be used as the source, and the generated systemd service will contain
a dependency on the `$name-volume.service`. Such a volume can be automatically be lazily
created by using a `$name.volume` quadlet file.

This key can be listed multiple times.

#### `Network=`

Specify a custom network for the container. This has the same format as the `--network` option
to `podman run`. For example, use `host` to use the host network in the container, or `none` to
not set up networking in the container.

This key can be listed multiple times.

#### `ExposeHostPort=`

Exposes a port, or a range of ports (e.g. `50-59`), from the host to the container. Equivalent
to the Podman `--expose` option.

This key can be listed multiple times.

#### `PublishPort=`

Exposes a port, or a range of ports (e.g. `50-59`), from the container to the host. Equivalent
to the Podman `--publish` option. The format is similar to the Podman options, which is of
the form `ip:hostPort:containerPort`, `ip::containerPort`, `hostPort:containerPort` or
`containerPort`, where the number of host and container ports must be the same (in the case
of a range).

If the IP is set to 0.0.0.0 or not set at all, the port will be bound on all IPv4 addresses on
the host; use [::] for IPv6.

Note that not listing a host port means that Podman will automatically select one, and it
may be different for each invocation of service. This makes that a less useful option. The
allocated port can be found with the `podman port` command.

This key can be listed multiple times.

#### `AddDevice=`

Adds a device node from the host into the container. The format of this is
`HOST-DEVICE[:CONTAINER-DEVICE][:PERMISSIONS]`, where `HOST-DEVICE` is the path of
the device node on the host, `CONTAINER-DEVICE` is the path of the device node in
the container, and `PERMISSIONS` is a list of permissions combining 'r' for read,
'w' for write, and 'm' for mknod(2).

This key can be listed multiple times.

#### `PodmanArgs=`

This key contains a list of arguments passed directly to the end of the `podman run` command
in the generated file (right before the image name in the command line). It can be used to
access Podman features otherwise unsupported by the generator. Since the generator is unaware
of what unexpected interactions can be caused by these arguments, is not recommended to use
this option.

The format of this is a space separated list of arguments, which can optionally be individually
escaped to allow inclusion of whitespace and other control characters. This key can be listed
multiple times.

#### `Label=`

Set one or more OCI labels on the container. The format is a list of `key=value` items,
similar to `Environment`.

This key can be listed multiple times.

#### `Annotation=`

Set one or more OCI annotations on the container. The format is a list of `key=value` items,
similar to `Environment`.

This key can be listed multiple times.

### Volume units

Volume files are named with a `.volume` extension and contain a section `[Volume]` describing the
named Podman volume. The generated service is a one-time command that ensures that the volume
exists on the host, creating it if needed.

For a volume file named `$NAME.volume`, the generated Podman volume will be called `systemd-$NAME`,
and the generated service file `$NAME-volume.service`.

Using volume units allows containers to depend on volumes being automatically pre-created. This is
particularly interesting when using special options to control volume creation, as Podman will
otherwise create volumes with the default options.

Supported keys in `Volume` section are:

#### `User=`

The host (numeric) uid, or user name to use as the owner for the volume

#### `Group=`

The host (numeric) gid, or group name to use as the group for the volume

#### `Label=`

Set one or more OCI labels on the volume. The format is a list of
`key=value` items, similar to `Environment`.

This key can be listed multiple times.

#### `Device=`

The path of a device which should be mounted for the volume.

#### `Type=`

The filesystem type of `Device` as used by the **mount(8)** commands `-t` flag.

#### `Options=`

The mount options to use for a filesystem as used by the **mount(8)** command `-o` flag.

#### `Copy=` (default to `yes`)

If enabled the content of the image located at the mountpoint of the volume is copied into the
volume on the first run.

### Network units

Network files are named with a `.network` extension and contain a section `[Network]` describing the
named Podman network. The generated service is a one-time command that ensures that the network
exists on the host, creating it if needed.

For a network file named `$NAME.network`, the generated Podman network will be called `systemd-$NAME`,
and the generated service file `$NAME-network.service`.

Using network units allows containers to depend on networks being automatically pre-created. This is
particularly interesting when using special options to control network creation, as Podman will
otherwise create networks with the default options.

Supported keys in `Network` section are:

#### `DisableDNS=` (defaults to `no`)

If enabled, disables the DNS plugin for this network.

This is equivalent to the Podman `--disable-dns` option

#### `Driver=` (defaults to `bridge`)

Driver to manage the network. Currently `bridge`, `macvlan` and `ipvlan` are supported.

This is equivalent to the Podman `--driver` option

#### `Gateway=`

Define a gateway for the subnet. If you want to provide a gateway address, you must also provide a subnet option.

This is equivalent to the Podman `--gateway` option

This key can be listed multiple times.

#### `Internal=` (defaults to `no`)

Restrict external access of this network.

This is equivalent to the Podman `--internal` option

#### `IPRange=`

Allocate  container  IP  from a range. The range must be a complete subnet and in CIDR notation. The ip-range option must be used with a subnet option.

This is equivalent to the Podman `--ip-range` option

This key can be listed multiple times.

#### `IPAMDriver=`

Set the ipam driver (IP Address Management Driver) for the network. Currently `host-local`, `dhcp` and `none` are supported.

This is equivalent to the Podman `--ipam-driver` option

#### `IPv6=`

Enable IPv6 (Dual Stack) networking.

This is equivalent to the Podman `--ipv6` option

#### `Options=`

Set driver specific options.

This is equivalent to the Podman `--opt` option

#### `Subnet=`

The subnet in CIDR notation.

This is equivalent to the Podman `--subnet` option

This key can be listed multiple times.

#### `Label=`

Set one or more OCI labels on the network. The format is a list of
`key=value` items, similar to `Environment`.

This key can be listed multiple times.
