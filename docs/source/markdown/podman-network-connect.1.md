## NAME
podman\-network\-connect - Connect a container to a network

## SYNOPSIS
**podman network connect** [*options*] network container

## DESCRIPTION
Connects a container to a network. A container can be connected to a network by name or by ID.
Once connected, the container can communicate with other containers in the same network.

## OPTIONS
#### **--alias**=*name*
Add network-scoped alias for the container. If the network has DNS enabled (`podman network inspect -f {{.DNSEnabled}} <NAME>`),
these aliases can be used for name resolution on the given network.  Multiple *--alias* options may be specified as input.
NOTE: When using CNI, a container only has access to aliases on the first network that it joins. This limitation does
not exist with netavark/aardvark-dns.

#### **--ip**=*address*
Set a static ipv4 address for this container on this network.

#### **--ip6**=*address*
Set a static ipv6 address for this container on this network.

#### **--mac-address**=*address*
Set a static mac address for this container on this network.

## EXAMPLES

Connect specified container to a named network:
```
podman network connect test web
```

Connect specified container to named network with two aliases:
```
podman network connect --alias web1 --alias web2 test web
```

Connect specified container to named network with a static ip:
```
podman network connect --ip 10.89.1.13 test web
```

Connect specified container to named network with a static mac address:
```
podman network connect --mac-address 92:d0:c6:0a:29:33 test web
```
