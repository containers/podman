## NAME
podman\-network - Manage Podman networks

## SYNOPSIS
**podman network** *subcommand*

## DESCRIPTION
The network command manages networks for Podman.

Podman supports two network backends [Netavark](https://github.com/containers/netavark)
and [CNI](https://www.cni.dev/). Netavark is the default network backend and was added in Podman v4.0. CNI will be deprecated in the future in preference of
Netavark. To configure
the network backend use the `network_backend` key under the `[Network]` in
**[containers.conf(5)](https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/docs/containers.conf.5.md)**.
New systems use netavark by default, to check what backend is used run
`podman info --format {{.Host.NetworkBackend}}`.

All network commands work for both backends but CNI and Netavark use different config files
so networks have to be created again after a backend change.

## SUBNET NOTES
Podman requires specific default IPs and, thus, network subnets.  The default values used by Podman can be modified in the **[containers.conf(5)](https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/docs/containers.conf.5.md)** file.

### Podman network
The default bridge network (called `podman`) uses 10.88.0.0/16 as a subnet. When Podman runs as root, the `podman` network is used as default.  It is the same as adding the option `--network bridge` or `--network podman`. This subnet can be changed in **[containers.conf(5)](https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/docs/containers.conf.5.md)** under the [network] section. Set the `default_subnet` to any subnet that is free in the environment. The name of the default network can also be changed from `podman` to another name using the default network key. Note that this is only done when no containers are running.

### Slirp4netns
When Podman is run as rootless, the internet connectivity is provided with slirp4netns by default. Slirp4nents uses 10.0.2.0/24 for its default network. This can also be changed in **[containers.conf(5)](https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/docs/containers.conf.5.md)** but under the `[engine]` section. Use the `network_cmd_options` key and add `["cidr=X.X.X.X/24"]` as a value. Note that slirp4netns needs a network prefix size between 1 and 25. This option accepts an array, so more options can be added in a comma-separated string as described on the **[podman-network-create(1)](podman-network-create.1.md)** man page. To change the CIDR for just one container, specify it on the cli using the `--network` option like this: `--network slirp4netns:cidr=192.168.1.0/24`.

When using the default network as rootless, i.e. --network podman/bridge, then it also uses the same subnet as described above in addition to the slirp4netns subnet.

### Podman network create
When a new network is created with a `podman network create` command, and no subnet is given with the --subnet option, Podman starts picking a free subnet from 10.89.0.0/24 to 10.255.255.0/24. Use the `default_subnet_pools` option under the `[network]` section in **[containers.conf(5)](https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/docs/containers.conf.5.md)** to change the range and/or size that is assigned by default.
