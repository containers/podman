## NAME
podman\-cp - Copy files/folders between a container and the local filesystem

## SYNOPSIS
**podman cp** [*options*] [*container*:]*src_path* [*container*:]*dest_path*

**podman container cp** [*options*] [*container*:]*src_path* [*container*:]*dest_path*

## DESCRIPTION
**podman cp** allows copying the contents of **src_path** to the **dest_path**. Files can be copied from a container to the local machine and vice versa or between two containers.
If `-` is specified for either the `SRC_PATH` or `DEST_PATH`, one can also stream a tar archive from `STDIN` or to `STDOUT`.

The containers can be either running or stopped and the *src_path* or *dest_path* can be a file or directory.

*IMPORTANT: The **podman cp** command assumes container paths are relative to the container's root directory (`/`), which means supplying the initial forward slash is optional and therefore sees `compassionate_darwin:/tmp/foo/myfile.txt` and `compassionate_darwin:tmp/foo/myfile.txt` as identical.*

Local machine paths can be an absolute or relative value.
The command interprets a local machine's relative paths as relative to the current working directory where **podman cp** is run.

Assuming a path separator of `/`, a first argument of **src_path** and second argument of **dest_path**, the behavior is as follows:

**src_path** specifies a file:
  - **dest_path** does not exist
    - the file is saved to a file created at **dest_path** (note that parent directory must exist).
  - **dest_path** exists and is a file
    - the destination is overwritten with the source file's contents.
  - **dest_path** exists and is a directory
    - the file is copied into this directory using the base name from **src_path**.

**src_path** specifies a directory:
  - **dest_path** does not exist
    - **dest_path** is created as a directory and the contents of the source directory are copied into this directory.
  - **dest_path** exists and is a file
    - Error condition: cannot copy a directory to a file.
  - **dest_path** exists and is a directory
    - **src_path** ends with `/`
      - the source directory is copied into this directory.
    - **src_path** ends with `/.` (i.e., slash followed by dot)
      - the content of the source directory is copied into this directory.

The command requires **src_path** and **dest_path** to exist according to the above rules.

If **src_path** is local and is a symbolic link, the symbolic target, is copied by default.

A *colon* ( : ) is used as a delimiter between a container and its path, it can also be used when specifying paths to a **src_path** or **dest_path** on a local machine, for example, `file:name.txt`.

*IMPORTANT: while using a *colon* ( : ) in a local machine path, one must be explicit with a relative or absolute path, for example: `/path/to/file:name.txt` or `./file:name.txt`*

Using `-` as the **src_path** streams the contents of `STDIN` as a tar archive. The command extracts the content of the tar to the `DEST_PATH` in the container. In this case, **dest_path** must specify a directory. Using `-` as the **dest_path** streams the contents of the resource (can be a directory) as a tar archive to `STDOUT`.

Note that `podman cp` ignores permission errors when copying from a running rootless container.  The TTY devices inside a rootless container are owned by the host's root user and hence cannot be read inside the container's user namespace.

Further note that `podman cp` does not support globbing (e.g., `cp dir/*.txt`).  If you want to copy multiple files from the host to the container you may use xargs(1) or find(1) (or similar tools for chaining commands) in conjunction with `podman cp`.  If you want to copy multiple files from the container to the host, you may use `podman mount CONTAINER` and operate on the returned mount point instead (see ALTERNATIVES below).

## OPTIONS

#### **--archive**, **-a**

Archive mode (copy all uid/gid information).
When set to true, files copied to a container will have changed ownership to the primary UID/GID of the container.
When set to false, maintain uid/gid from archive sources instead of changing them to the primary uid/gid of the destination container.
The default is **true**.

#### **--overwrite**

Allow directories to be overwritten with non-directories and vice versa.  By default, `podman cp` errors out when attempting to overwrite, for instance, a regular file with a directory.  Use this option, if you want to allow this behavior.

## ALTERNATIVES

Podman has much stronger capabilities than just `podman cp` to achieve copying files between the host and containers.

Using standard **[podman-mount(1)](podman-mount.1.md)** and **[podman-unmount(1)](podman-unmount.1.md)** takes advantage of the entire linux tool chain, rather than just cp.

copying contents out of a container or into a container, can be achieved with a few simple commands. For example:

To copy the `/etc/foobar` directory out of a container and onto `/tmp` on the host, the following commands can be executed:

	mnt=$(podman mount CONTAINERID)
	cp -R ${mnt}/etc/foobar /tmp
	podman umount CONTAINERID

To untar a tar ball into a container, following commands can be executed:

	mnt=$(podman mount CONTAINERID)
	tar xf content.tgz -C ${mnt}
	podman umount CONTAINERID

To install a package into a container that
does not have dnf installed, following commands can be executed:

	mnt=$(podman mount CONTAINERID)
	dnf install --installroot=${mnt} httpd
	chroot ${mnt} rm -rf /var/log/dnf /var/cache/dnf
	podman umount CONTAINERID

By using `podman mount` and `podman unmount`, one can use all of the
standard linux tools for moving files into and out of containers, not just
the cp command.

## EXAMPLES

- Copy a file from host to a container.
  ```
  podman cp /myapp/app.conf containerID:/myapp/app.conf
  ```

- Copy a file from a container to a directory on another container.
  ```
  podman cp containerID1:/myfile.txt containerID2:/tmp
  ```

- Copy a directory on a container to a directory on the host.
  ```
  podman cp containerID:/myapp/ /myapp/
  ```

- Copy the contents of a directory on a container to a directory on the host.
  ```
  podman cp containerID:/home/myuser/. /home/myuser/
  ```

- Copy a directory on a container into a directory on another.
  ```
  podman cp containerA:/myapp containerB:/yourapp
  ```

- Stream a tar archive from `STDIN` to a container.
  ```
  podman cp - containerID:/myfiles.tar.gz < myfiles.tar.gz
  ```
