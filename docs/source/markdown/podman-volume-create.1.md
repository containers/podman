## NAME
podman\-volume\-create - Create a new volume

## SYNOPSIS
**podman volume create** [*options*] [*name*]

## DESCRIPTION

Creates an empty volume and prepares it to be used by containers. The volume
can be created with a specific name, if a name is not given a random name is
generated. You can add metadata to the volume by using the **--label** flag and
driver options can be set using the **--opt** flag.

## OPTIONS

#### **--driver**=*driver*

Specify the volume driver name (default **local**). Setting this to a value other than **local** Podman attempts to create the volume using a volume plugin with the given name. Such plugins must be defined in the **volume_plugins** section of the **[containers.conf(5)](https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/docs/containers.conf.5.md)** configuration file.

#### **--help**

Print usage statement

#### **--label**=*label*, **-l**

Set metadata for a volume (e.g., --label mykey=value).

#### **--opt**=*option*, **-o**

Set driver specific options.
For the default driver, **local**, this allows a volume to be configured to mount a filesystem on the host.
For the `local` driver the following options are supported: `type`, `device`, `o`, and `[no]copy`.
The `type` option sets the type of the filesystem to be mounted, and is equivalent to the `-t` flag to **mount(8)**.
The `device` option sets the device to be mounted, and is equivalent to the `device` argument to **mount(8)**.
The `copy` option enables copying files from the container image path where the mount is created to the newly created volume on the first run.  `copy` is the default.

The `o` option sets options for the mount, and is equivalent to the `-o` flag to **mount(8)** with these exceptions:

  - The `o` option supports `uid` and `gid` options to set the UID and GID of the created volume that are not normally supported by **mount(8)**.
  - The `o` option supports the `size` option to set the maximum size of the created volume, the `inodes` option to set the maximum number of inodes for the volume and `noquota` to completely disable quota support even for tracking of disk usage. Currently these flags are only supported on "xfs" file system mounted with the `prjquota` flag described in the **xfs_quota(8)** man page.
  - The `o` option supports using volume options other than the UID/GID options with the **local** driver and requires root privileges.
  - The `o` options supports the `timeout` option which allows users to set a driver specific timeout in seconds before volume creation fails. For example, **--opts=o=timeout=10** sets a driver timeout of 10 seconds.

When not using the **local** driver, the given options are passed directly to the volume plugin. In this case, supported options are dictated by the plugin in question, not Podman.

## EXAMPLES

```
$ podman volume create myvol

$ podman volume create

$ podman volume create --label foo=bar myvol

# podman volume create --opt device=tmpfs --opt type=tmpfs --opt o=nodev,noexec myvol

# podman volume create --opt device=tmpfs --opt type=tmpfs --opt o=uid=1000,gid=1000 testvol
```

## QUOTAS

podman volume create uses `XFS project quota controls` for controlling the size and the number of inodes of builtin volumes. The directory used to store the volumes must be an`XFS` file system and be mounted with the `pquota` option.

Example /etc/fstab entry:
```
/dev/podman/podman-var /var xfs defaults,x-systemd.device-timeout=0,pquota 1 2
```

Podman generates project ids for each builtin volume, but these project ids need to be unique for the XFS file system. These project ids by default are generated randomly, with a potential for overlap with other quotas on the same file
system.

The xfs_quota tool can be used to assign a project id to the storage driver directory, e.g.:

```
echo 100000:/var/lib/containers/storage/overlay >> /etc/projects
echo 200000:/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes >> /etc/projects
echo storage:100000 >> /etc/projid
echo volumes:200000 >> /etc/projid
xfs_quota -x -c 'project -s storage volumes' /<xfs mount point>
```

In the example above we are configuring the overlay storage driver for newly
created containers as well as volumes to use project ids with a **start offset**.
All containers will be assigned larger project ids (e.g. >= 100000).
All volume assigned project ids larger project ids starting with 200000.
This prevents xfs_quota management conflicts with containers/storage.
