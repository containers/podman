## NAME
podman-container-runlabel - Execute a command as described by a container-image label

## SYNOPSIS
**podman container runlabel** [*options*] *label* *image* [*arg...*]

## DESCRIPTION
**podman container runlabel** reads the specified `label` of the `image` and executes it as command on the host.  If the label does not exist, Podman exits with an error.  Additional arguments are appended to the command.

Historically, container images describe the contents (e.g., layers) and how a container runtime (e.g., crun(1) or runc(1)) executes the container.  For instance, an image may set the environment and the command in its configuration.  However, a container image cannot directly specify how a container engine such as Podman executes it.  For instance, an image configuration does not include information about log drivers, namespaces, or which capabilities it needs to run correctly.

`podman container runlabel` addresses the limitation of container images in a simple yet efficient way.  Podman reads the contents of the label and interpret it as a command that is executed on the host.  This way an image can describe exactly how it is executed by Podman.  For instance, a label with the content `/usr/bin/podman run -d --pid=host --privileged \${IMAGE}` instructs the image to be executed in a detached, privileged container that is using the PID namespace of the host.  This lifts the self-description of a container image from "what" to "how".

Note that the `runlabel` command is intended to be run in trusted environments exclusively.  Using the command on untrusted images is not recommended.

## VARIABLES

The contents of a label may refer to the following variables which is substituted while processing the label.

**IMAGE**
The name of the image.  When executing `podman container runlabel label fedora` the `IMAGE` variable is replaced with `fedora`.  Valid formats are `IMAGE`, `$IMAGE`, `${IMAGE}` and `=IMAGE`.

**NAME**
As specified by the `--name` option.  The format is identical to the one of the IMAGE attribute.

**PWD**
Will be replaced with the current working directory.

## OPTIONS

@@option authfile

@@option cert-dir

@@option creds

#### **--display**

Display the label's value of the image having populated its environment variables.  The runlabel command is not executed if --display is specified.

#### **--help**, **-h**
Print usage statement

#### **--name**, **-n**=*name*

Use this name for creating content for the container.  If not specified, name defaults to the name of the image.

#### **--quiet**, **-q**

Suppress output information when pulling images

#### **--replace**

If a container exists with the current name, it is stopped, deleted and a new container is created from this image.

@@option tls-verify

## EXAMPLES
