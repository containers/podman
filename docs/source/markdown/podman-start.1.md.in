## NAME
podman\-start - Start one or more containers

## SYNOPSIS
**podman start** [*options*] *container* ...

**podman container start** [*options*] *container* ...

## DESCRIPTION
Start one or more containers using container IDs or names as input.  The *attach* and *interactive*
options cannot be used to override the *--tty* and *--interactive* options from when the container
was created. Starting an already running container with the *--attach* option, Podman simply
attaches to the container.

## OPTIONS

#### **--all**

Start all the containers, default is only running containers.

#### **--attach**, **-a**

Attach container's STDOUT and STDERR.  The default is false. This option cannot be used when
starting multiple containers.

@@option detach-keys

#### **--filter**, **-f**

Filter what containers are going to be started from the given arguments.
Multiple filters can be given with multiple uses of the --filter flag.
Filters with the same key work inclusive with the only exception being
`label` which is exclusive. Filters with different keys always work exclusive.

Valid filters are listed below:
