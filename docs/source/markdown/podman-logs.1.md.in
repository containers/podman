## NAME
podman\-logs - Display the logs of one or more containers

## SYNOPSIS
**podman logs** [*options*] *container* [*container...*]

**podman container logs** [*options*] *container* [*container...*]

## DESCRIPTION
The podman logs command batch-retrieves whatever logs are present for one or more containers at the time of execution.
This does not guarantee execution order when combined with podman run (i.e. your run may not have generated
any logs at the time you execute podman logs).

## OPTIONS

@@option color

@@option follow

#### **--latest**, **-l**

Instead of providing the container name or ID, use the last created container. If you use methods other than Podman
to run containers such as CRI-O, the last started container could be from either of those methods. (This option is not available with the remote Podman client, including Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

#### **--names**, **-n**

Output the container name in the log

@@option since

@@option tail

@@option timestamps

@@option until
