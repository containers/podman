# Release Notes

## 4.0.0
### Features
- Podman has seen an extensive rewrite of its network stack to add support for Netavark, a new tool for configuring container networks, in addition to the existing CNI stack. Netavark will be default on new installations when it is available.
- The `podman network connect` command now supports three new options, `--ip`, `--ip6`, and `--mac-address`, to specify configuration for the new network that will be attached.
- The `podman network create` command now allows the `--subnet`, `--gateway`, and `--ip-range` options to be specified multiple times, to allow for the creation of dual-stack IPv4 and IPv6 networks with user-specified subnets.
- The `--network` option to `podman create`, `podman pod create`, `podman run`, and `podman play kube` can now, when specifying a network name, also specify advanced network options such as `alias`, `ip`, `mac`, and `interface_name`, allowing advanced configuration of networks when creating containers connected to more than one network.
- The `podman play kube` command can now specify the `--net` option multiple times, to connect created containers and pods to multiple networks.
- The `podman create`, `podman pod create`, and `podman run` commands now support a new option, `--ip6`, to specify a static IPv6 address for the created container or pod to use.
- Macvlan networks can now configure the mode of the network via the `-o mode=` option.
- When using the CNI network stack, a new network driver, `ipvlan`, is now available.
- The `podman info` command will now print the network backend in use (Netavark or CNI).
- The network backend to use can be now be specified in `containers.conf` via the `network_backend` field. Please note that it is not recommended to switch backends while containers exist, and a system reboot is recommended after doing so.
- All Podman commands now support a new option, `--noout`, that suppresses all output to STDOUT.
- All commands that can remove containers (`podman rm --force`, `podman pod rm --force`, `podman volume rm --force`, `podman network rm --force`) now accept a `--time` option to specify the timeout on stopping the container before resorting to `SIGKILL` (identical to the `--time` flag to `podman stop`).
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a new option, `--passwd`, that uses the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/groups` files from the image in the created container without changes by Podman ([#11805](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11805)).
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a new option, `--hostuser`, that creates one or more users in the container based on users from the host (e.g. with matching username, UID, and GID).
- The `podman create` and `podman run` commands now support two new options, `--unsetenv` and `--unsetenv-all`, to clear default environment variables set by Podman and by the container image ([#11836](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11836)).
- The `podman rm` command now supports a new option, `--depend`, which recursively removes a given container and all containers that depend on it ([#10360](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10360)).
- All commands that support filtering their output based on labels (e.g. `podman volume ls`, `podman ps`) now support labels specified using regular expressions (e.g. `--filter label=some.prefix.com/key/*`).
- The `podman pod create` command now supports the `--volume` option, allowing volumes to be specified that will be mounted automatically to all containers in the pod ([#10379](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10379)).
- The `podman pod create` command now supports the `--device` option, allowing devices to be specified that will be mounted automatically to all containers in the pod.
- The `podman pod create` command now supports the `--volumes-from` option, allowing volumes from an existing Podman container to be mounted automatically to all containers in the pod.
- The `podman pod create` command now supports the `--security-opt` option, allowing security settings (e.g. disabling SELinux or Seccomp) to be configured automatically for all containers in the pod ([#12173](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12173)).
- The `podman pod create` command now supports the `--share-parent` option, which defaults to true, controlling whether containers in the pod will use a shared cgroup parent.
- The `podman pod create` command now supports the `--sysctl` option, allowing sysctls to be configured automatically for all containers in the pod.
- The `podman events` command now supports the `--no-trunc` option, which will allow short container IDs to be displayed instead of the default full IDs. The flag defaults to true, so full IDs remain the default ([#8941](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8941)).
- The `podman machine init` command now supports a new VM type, `wsl`, available only on Windows; this uses WSL as a backend for `podman machine`, instead of creating a separate VM and managing it via QEMU ([#12503](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/12503)).
- The `podman machine init` command now supports a new option, `--now`, to start the VM immediately after creating it.
- The `podman machine init` command now supports a new option, `--volume`, to mount contents from the host into the created virtual machine.
- Virtual machines created by `podman machine` now automatically mount the Podman API socket to the host, so consumers of the Podman or Docker APIs can use them directly from the host machine ([#11462](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11462)).
- Virtual machines created by `podman machine` now automatically mount certificates from the host's keychain into the virtual machine ([#11507](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11507)).
- Virtual machines created by `podman machine` now automatically propagate standard proxy environment variables from the host into the virtual machine, including copying any required certificates from `SSL_FILE_CERT` into the VM.
- The `podman machine ssh` command now supports a new option, `--username`, to specify the username to connect to the VM with.
- Port forwarding from VMs created using `podman machine` now supports ports specified using custom host IPs (e.g. `-p 127.0.0.1:8080:80`), the UDP protocol, and containers created using the `slirp4netns` network mode ([#11528](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11528) and [#11728](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11728)).
- The `podman system connection rm` command supports a new option, `--all`, to remove all available connections ([#12018](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12018)).
- The `podman system service` command's default timeout is now configured via `containers.conf` (using the `service_timeout` field) instead of hardcoded to 5 seconds.
- The `--mount type=devpts` option to `podman create` and `podman run` now supports new options: `uid`, `gid`, `mode`, and `max`.
- The `--volume` option to `podman create` and `podman run` now supports a new option, `:idmap`, which using an ID mapping filesystem to allow multiple containers with disjoint UID and GID ranges mapped into them access the same volume ([#12154](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12154)).
- The `U` option for volumes, which changes the ownership of the mounted volume to ensure the user running in the container can access it, can now be used with the `--mount` option to `podman create` and `podman run`, as well as the `--volume` option where it was already available.
- The `:O` option for volumes, which specifies that an overlay filesystem will be mounted over the volume and ensures changes do not persist, is now supported with named volumes as well as bind mounts.
- The `:O` option for volumes now supports two additional options, `upperdir` and `workdir`, which allow for specifying custom upper directories and work directories for the created overlay filesystem.
- Podman containers created from a user-specified root filesystem (via `--rootfs`) can now create an overlay filesystem atop the user-specified rootfs which ensures changes will not persist by suffixing the user-specified root filesystem with `:O`.
- The `podman save` command has a new option, `--uncompressed`, which saves the layers of the image without compression ([#11613](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11613)).
- Podman supports a new log driver for containers, `passthrough`, which logs all output directly to the STDOUT and STDERR of the `podman` command; it is intended for use in systemd-managed containers.
- The `podman build` command now supports two new options, `--unsetenv` and `--all-platforms`.
- The `podman image prune` command now supports a new option, `--external`, which allows containers not created by Podman (e.g. temporary containers from Buildah builds) to be pruned ([#11472](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11472)).
- Two new aliases for `podman image prune` have been added for Docker compatibility: `podman builder prune` and `podman buildx prune`.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports a new option, `--no-hosts`, which uses the `/etc/hosts` file from the image in all generated containers, preventing any modifications to the hosts file from Podman ([#9500](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9500)).
- The `podman play kube` command now supports a new option, `--replace`, which will replace any existing containers and pods with the same names as the containers and pods that will be created by the command ([#11481](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11481)).
- The `podman play kube` command now supports a new option, `--log-opt`, which allows the logging configuration of generated containers and pods to be adjusted ([#11727](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11727)).
- The `podman play kube` command now supports Kubernetes YAML that specifies volumes from a configmap.
- The `podman generate systemd` command now supports a new option, `--template`, to generate template unit files.
- The `podman generate systemd` command now supports a new option, `--start-timeout`, to override the default start timeout for generated unit files ([#11618](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11618)).
- The `podman generate systemd` command now supports a new option, `--restart-sec`, to override the default time before a failed unit is restarted by systemd for generated unit files.
- The `podman generate systemd` command now supports three new options, `--wants`, `--after`, and `--requires`, which allow detailed control of systemd dependencies in generated unit files.
- The `podman container checkpoint` and `podman container restore` commands can now print statistics about the checkpoint operation via a new option, `--print-stats`.
- The `podman container checkpoint` and `podman container restore` commands can now checkpoint and restore containers which make use of file locks via a new option, `--file-locks`.
- The `podman container restore` command can now be used with containers created using the host IPC namespace (`--ipc=host`).
- The `podman container checkpoint` and `podman container restore` commands now handle checkpointing and restoring the contents of `/dev/shm`.
- The `podman container checkpoint` and `podman container restore` commands are now supported with the remote Podman client ([#12007](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12007)).
- The `podman inspect` command on containers now includes additional output fields for checkpointed and restored containers, including information about when the container was checkpointed or restored, and the path to the checkpoint/restore log.
- The `podman secret list` command now supports a new option, `--filter`, to filter what secrets are returned.
- The `podman image scp` command can now be used to transfer images between users (both root and rootless) on the same system, without requiring `sshd`.
- The `podman image sign` command now supports a new option, `--authfile`, to specify an alternative path to authentication credentials ([#10866](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10866)).
- The `podman load` command now supports downloading files via HTTP and HTTPS if a URL is given ([#11970](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11970)).
- The `podman push` command now supports a new option, `--compression-format`, to choose the compression algorithm used to compress image layers.
- The `podman volume create` command now allows volumes using the `local` driver that require mounting to be used by non-root users. This allows `tmpfs` and `bind` volumes to be created by non-root users ([#12013](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12013)).
- A new command, `podman dial-stdio`, has been added; this command should not be invoked directly, but is used by some clients of the Docker Remote API, and is provided for Docker compatibility ([#11668](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11668)).

### Breaking Changes
- Podman v4.0 will perform several schema migrations in the Podman database when it is first run. These schema migrations will cause Podman v3.x and earlier to be unable to read certain network configuration information from the database, so downgrading from Podman v4.0 to an earlier version will cause containers to lose their static IP, MAC address, and port bindings.
- All endpoints of the Docker-compatible API now enforce that all image shortnames will be resolved to the Docker Hub for improved Docker compatibility. This behavior can be turned off via the `compat_api_enforce_docker_hub` option in `containers.conf` ([#12320](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12320)).
- The Podman APIs for Manifest List and Network operations have been completely rewritten to address issues and inconsistencies in the previous APIs. Incompatible APIs should warn if they are used with an older Podman client.
- The `make install` makefile target no longer implicitly builds Podman, and will fail if `make` was not run prior to it.
- The `podman rm --depends`, `podman rmi --force`, and `podman network rm --force` commands can now remove pods if a they need to remove an infra container (e.g. `podman rmi --force` on the infra image will remove all pods and infra containers). Previously, any command that tried to remove an infra container would error.
- The `podman system reset` command now removes all networks on the system, in addition to all volumes, pods, containers, and images.
- If the `CONTAINER_HOST` environment variable is set, Podman will default to connecting to the remote Podman service specified by the environment variable, instead of running containers locally ([#11196](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11196)).
- Healthcheck information from `podman inspect` on a container has had its JSON tag renamed from `Healthcheck` to `Health` for improved Docker compatibility. An alias has been added so that using the old name with the `--format` option will still work ([#11645](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11645)).
- Secondary IP and IPv6 addresses from `podman inspect` on a container (`SecondaryIPAddresses` and `SecondaryIPv6Addresses`) have been changed from arrays of strings to arrays of structs for improved Docker compatibility (the struct now includes IP address and prefix length).
- The `podman volume rm --force` command will now remove containers that depend on the volume that are running (previously, it would only remove stopped containers).
- The output of the `podman search` command has been altered to remove the Index, Stars, and Automated columns, as these were not used by registries that are not Dockerhub.
- The `host.containers.internal` entry in `/etc/hosts` for rootless containers now points to a public IP address of the host machine, to ensure the container can reach the host (the previous value, a slirp4netns address, did not actually point to the host) ([#12000](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12000)).
- Containers created in pods that have an infra container can no longer independently configure a user namespace via `--uidmap` and `--gidmap` ([#12669](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12669)).
- Several container states have been renamed internally - for example, the previous `Configured` state is now named `Created`, and the previous `Created` state is now `Initialized`. The `podman ps` command already normalized these names for Docker compatibility, so this will only be visible when inspecting containers with `podman inspect`.

### Changes
- Podman containers will now automatically add the container's short ID as a network alias when connected to a supporting network ([#11748](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11748)).
- The `podman machine stop` command will now log when machines are successfully stopped ([#11542](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11542)).
- The `podman machine stop` command now waits until the VM has stopped to return; previously, it returned immediately after the shutdown command was sent, without waiting for the VM to shut down.
- VMs created by `podman machine` now delegate more cgroup controllers to the rootless user used to run containers, allowing for additional resource limits to be used ([#13054](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13054)).
- The `podman stop` command will now log a warning to the console if the stop timeout expires and `SIGKILL` must be used to stop the container ([#11854](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11854)).
- Several performance optimizations have been implemented that should speed up container and pod creation, and running containers and pods that forward large ranges of ports.
- The `--no-trunc` argument to the `podman search` command now defaults to true.
- Rootless port forwarding using the `rootlessport` port forwarder is now handled by a separate binary, not Podman itself, which results in significantly reduced memory usage ([#10790](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10790)).
- The `podman system connection ls` command now has a separate output column to show which connection is currently the default (instead appending `*` to the default connection's name) ([#12019](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12019)).
- The `--kernel-memory` option to `podman run` and `podman create` has been deprecated in the upstream OCI runtime specification, and is now also deprecated in Podman and will be removed in a future release. Use of the flag will result in a warning.
- Podman will now ship build the pause image used by pods locally, instead of pulling it from the network (using the existing `catatoinit` binary used for `podman run --init`). This allows pods to be easily used on systems without an internet connection.
- The `--rootless-cni` option to `podman unshare` has been renamed to `--rootless-netns`. The old name has been aliased to the new one and will still function, but may be removed in a future release.
- The `--cni-config-dir` option to all Podman commands has been renamed to `--network-config-dir` as it will not be used with Netavark as well as CNI. The old name has been aliased to the new one and will still function, but may be removed in a future release.
- The `--format` option to all Podman commands has been changed to improved functionality and Docker compatibility ([#10974](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10974)).
- The `podman ps --external` flag previously required `--all` to also be specified; this is no longer true
- The port-forwarding logic previously contined in the `podman-machine-cni` CNI plugin has been integrated directly into Podman. The `podman-machine-cni` plugin is no longer necessary and should be removed.
- The `--device` flag to `podman create`, `podman run`, and `podman pod create` would previously refuse to mount devices when Podman was run as a non-root user and no permission to access the device was available; it will now mount these devices without checking permissions ([#12704](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12704)).

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where networks could be created with the same name as a container network mode (e.g. `host`) ([#11448](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11448)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman save` command was not automatically removing signatures from saved images.
- Fixed a bug where a rare race condition could cause `podman run --rm` to return an error that a given container did not exist when trying to remove it, despite it having been safely removed ([#11775](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11775)).
- Fixed a bug where a rare race condition could cause `podman ps` to return an error if a container was removed while the command was running ([#11810](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11810)).
- Fixed a bug where running Kube YAML with a CPU limit would using `podman play kube` would result in errors ([#11803](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11803)).

- Fixed a bug where the `podman build` command did not properly propagate non-0 exit codes from Buildah when builds failed.
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command could fail to build images when the remote client was run on Windows and the Containerfile contained `COPY` instructions ([#13119](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13119)).
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `--secret` option to the `podman build` command was nonfunctional.

- Fixed a bug where certain annotations used internally by Podman could be set by images, resulting in `podman inspect` reporting incorrect information ([#12671](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12671)).
- Fixed a bug where named volumes would not copy-up after being mounted over an empty directory, then subsequently mounted over a non-empty directory in another container ([#12714](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12714)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman inspect` command on containers was URL-encoding special characters in strings (e.g. healthcheck commands).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate kube` command would generate YAML including optional environment variables from secrets and configmaps that are not included ([#12553](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12553)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman pod create` command would ignore the default infra image specified in `containers.conf` ([#12771](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12771)).

- Fixed a bug where secrets could not be mounted into containers that joined a user namespace (e.g. `--userns=auto`) ([#12779](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12779)).
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could produce an error about cgroups when containers were created inside existing pods ([#10800](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10800)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman could error that a systemd session was not available despite having the cgroup manager set to `cgroupfs` ([#12802](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12802)).
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client on Windows would ignore environment variables from the `--env` option to `podman create` and `podman run` ([#12056](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12056)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman could segfault when an error occurred trying to set up rootless mode.
- Fixed a bug where Podman could segfault when reading an image layer that did not have a creation timestamp set.
- Fixed a bug where, when Podman's storage directories were on an NFS filesystem, Podman would leave some unneeded file descriptors open, causing errors when containers were removed.
- Fixed a bug where, when Podman's storage directories were on an NFS filesystem, cleaning up a container's exec sessions could fail.
- Fixed a bug where Podman commands that operate on a container could give an incorrect error message if given a partial ID that could refer to 2 or more containers ([#12963](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12963)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman stats` command would not show network usage statistics on containers using `slirp4netns` for networking ([#11695](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11695)).
- Fixed a bug where the `/dev/shm` mount in the container was not mounted with `nosuid`, `noexec`, and `nodev` mount options.
- Fixed a bug where the `--shm-size` option to `podman create` and `podman run` interpeted human-readable sizes as KB instead of KiB, and GB instead of GiB (such that a kilobyte was interpreted as 1000 bytes, instead of 1024 bytes) ([#13096](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13096)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--share=cgroup` option to `podman pod create` controlled whether the pod used a shared Cgroup parent, not whether the Cgroup namespace was shared ([#12765](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12765)).
- Fixed a bug where, when a Podman container using the `slirp4netns` network mode was run inside a systemd unit file, systemd could kill the `slirp4netns` process, which is shared between all containers for a given user (thus causing all `slirp4netns`-mode containers for that user to be unable to connect to the internet) ([#13153](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13153)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman network connect` and `podman network disconnect` commands would not update `/etc/resolv.conf` in the container to add or remove the DNS servers of the networks that were connected or disconnected ([#9603](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9603)).

### API
- The Podman remote API version has been bumped to v4.0.0.

## 3.4.0
### Features
- Pods now support init containers! Init containers are containers which run before the rest of the pod starts. There are two types of init containers: "always", which always run before the pod is started, and "once", which only run the first time the pod starts and are subsequently removed. They can be added using the `podman create` command's `--init-ctr` option.
- Support for init containers has also been added to `podman play kube` and `podman generate kube` - init containers contained in Kubernetes YAML will be created as Podman init containers, and YAML generated by Podman will include any init containers created.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports building images. If the `--build` option is given and a directory with the name of the specified image exists in the current working directory and contains a valid Containerfile or Dockerfile, the image will be built and used for the container.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports a new option, `--teardown`, which removes any pods and containers created by the given Kubernetes YAML.
- The `podman generate kube` command now generates annotations for SELinux mount options on volume (`:z` and `:Z`) that are respected by the `podman play kube` command.
- A new command has been added, `podman pod logs`, to return logs for all containers in a pod at the same time.
- Two new commands have been added, `podman volume export` (to export a volume to a tar file) and `podman volume import`) (to populate a volume from a given tar file).
- The `podman auto-update` command now supports simple rollbacks. If a container fails to start after an automatic update, it will be rolled back to the previous image and restarted again.
- Pods now share their user namespace by default, and the `podman pod create` command now supports the `--userns` option. This allows rootless pods to be created with the `--userns=keep-id` option.
- The `podman pod ps` command now supports a new filter with its `--filter` option, `until`, which returns pods created before a given timestamp.
- The `podman image scp` command has been added. This command allows images to be transferred between different hosts.
- The `podman stats` command supports a new option, `--interval`, to specify the amount of time before the information is refreshed.
- The `podman inspect` command now includes ports exposed (but not published) by containers (e.g. ports from `--expose` when `--publish-all` is not specified).
- The `podman inspect` command now has a new boolean value, `Checkpointed`, which indicates that a container was stopped as a result of a `podman container checkpoint` operation.
- Volumes created by `podman volume create` now support setting quotas when run atop XFS. The `size` and `inode` options allow the maximum size and maximum number of inodes consumed by a volume to be limited.
- The `podman info` command now outputs information on what log drivers, network drivers, and volume plugins are available for use ([#11265](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11265)).
- The `podman info` command now outputs the current log driver in use, and the variant and codename of the distribution in use.
- The parameters of the VM created by `podman machine init` (amount of disk space, memory, CPUs) can now be set in `containers.conf`.
- The `podman machine ls` command now shows additional information (CPUs, memory, disk size) about VMs managed by `podman machine`.
- The `podman ps` command now includes healthcheck status in container state for containers that have healthchecks ([#11527](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11527)).

### Changes
- The `podman build` command has a new alias, `podman buildx`, to improve compatibility with Docker. We have already added support for many `docker buildx` flags to `podman build` and aim to continue to do so.
- Cases where Podman is run without a user session or a writable temporary files directory will now produce better error messages.
- The default log driver has been changed from `file` to `journald`. The `file` driver did not properly support log rotation, so this should lead to a better experience. If journald is not available on the system, Podman will automatically revert to the `file`.
- Podman no longer depends on `ip` for removing networks ([#11403](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11403)).
- The deprecated `--macvlan` flag to `podman network create` now warns when it is used. It will be removed entirely in the Podman 4.0 release.
- The `podman machine start` command now prints a message when the VM is successfully started.
- The `podman stats` command can now be used on containers that are paused.
- The `podman unshare` command will now return the exit code of the command that was run in the user namespace (assuming the command was successfully run).
- Successful healthchecks will no longer add a `healthy` line to the system log to reduce log spam.
- As a temporary workaround for a lack of shortname prompts in the Podman remote client, VMs created by `podman machine` now default to only using the `docker.io` registry.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where whitespace in the definition of sysctls (particularly default sysctls specified in `containers.conf`) would cause them to be parsed incorrectly.
- Fixed a bug where the Windows remote client improperly validated volume paths ([#10900](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10900)).

- Fixed a bug where the `/etc/hosts` file was not guaranteed to contain an entry for `localhost` (this is still not guaranteed if `--net=host` is used; such containers will exactly match the host's `/etc/hosts`) ([#11411](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11411)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine start` command could print warnings about unsupported CPU features ([#11421](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11421)).

- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman run` and `podman exec` commands could skip a byte of output every 8192 bytes ([#11496](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11496)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman stats` command would print nonsensical results if the container restarted while it was running ([#11469](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11469)).

- Fixed a bug where `podman machine` commands would not properly locate the `gvproxy` binary in some circumstances.
- Fixed a bug where containers created as part of a pod using the `--pod-id-file` option would not join the pod's network namespace ([#11303](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11303)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman, when using the systemd cgroups driver, could sometimes leak dbus sessions.

### API
- A large number of potential file descriptor leaks from improperly closing client connections have been fixed.

## 3.3.0
### Features
- Containers inside VMs created by `podman machine` will now automatically handle port forwarding - containers in `podman machine` VMs that publish ports via `--publish` or `--publish-all` will have these ports not just forwarded on the VM, but also on the host system.
- The `podman play kube` command's `--network` option now accepts advanced network options (e.g. `--network slirp4netns:port_handler=slirp4netns`) ([#10807](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10807)).
- The `podman play kube` command now supports Kubernetes liveness probes, which will be created as Podman healthchecks.
- Podman now provides a systemd unit, `podman-restart.service`, which, when enabled, will restart all containers that were started with `--restart=always` after the system reboots.
- Rootless Podman can now be configured to use CNI networking by default by using the `rootless_networking` option in `containers.conf`.
- Images can now be pulled using `image:tag@digest` syntax (e.g. `podman pull fedora:34@sha256:1b0d4ddd99b1a8c8a80e885aafe6034c95f266da44ead992aab388e6aa91611a`) ([#6721](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6721)).
- The `podman container checkpoint` and `podman container restore` commands can now be used to checkpoint containers that are in pods, and restore those containers into pods.
- The `podman container restore` command now features a new option, `--publish`, to change the ports that are forwarded to a container that is being restored from an exported checkpoint.
- The `podman container checkpoint` command now features a new option, `--compress`, to specify the compression algorithm that will be used on the generated checkpoint.
- The `podman pull` command can now pull multiple images at once (e.g. `podman pull fedora:34 ubi8:latest` will pull both specified images).
- THe `podman cp` command can now copy files from one container into another directly (e.g. `podman cp containera:/etc/hosts containerb:/etc/`) ([#7370](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7370)).
- The `podman cp` command now supports a new option, `--archive`, which controls whether copied files will be chown'd to the UID and GID of the user of the destination container.
- The `podman stats` command now provides two additional metrics: Average CPU, and CPU time.
- The `podman pod create` command supports a new flag, `--pid`, to specify the PID namespace of the pod. If specified, containers that join the pod will automatically share its PID namespace.
- The `podman pod create` command supports a new flag, `--infra-name`, which allows the name of the pod's infra container to be set ([#10794](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10794)).
- The `podman auto-update` command has had its output reformatted - it is now much clearer what images were pulled and what containers were updated.
- The `podman auto-update` command now supports a new option, `--dry-run`, which reports what would be updated but does not actually perform the update ([#9949](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9949)).
- The `podman build` command now supports a new option, `--secret`, to mount secrets into build containers.
- The `podman manifest remove` command now has a new alias, `podman manifest rm`.
- The `podman login` command now supports a new option, `--verbose`, to print detailed information about where the credentials entered were stored.
- The `podman events` command now supports a new event, `exec_died`, which is produced when an exec session exits, and includes the exit code of the exec session.
- The `podman system connection add` command now supports adding connections that connect using the `tcp://` and `unix://` URL schemes.
- The `podman system connection list` command now supports a new flag, `--format`, to determine how the output is printed.
- The `podman volume prune` and `podman volume ls` commands' `--filter` option now support a new filter, `until`, that matches volumes created before a certain time ([#10579](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10579)).
- The `podman ps --filter` option's `network` filter now accepts a new value: `container:`, which matches containers that share a network namespace with a specific container ([#10361](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10361)).
- The `podman diff` command can now accept two arguments, allowing two images or two containers to be specified; the diff between the two will be printed ([#10649](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10649)).
- Podman can now optionally copy-up content from containers into volumes mounted into those containers earlier (at creation time, instead of at runtime) via the `prepare_on_create` option in `containers.conf` ([#10262](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10262)).
- A new option, `--gpus`, has been added to `podman create` and `podman run` as a no-op for better compatibility with Docker. If the nvidia-container-runtime package is installed, GPUs should be automatically added to containers without using the flag.
- If an invalid subcommand is provided, similar commands to try will now be suggested in the error message.

### Changes
- The `podman system reset` command now removes non-Podman (e.g. Buildah and CRI-O) containers as well.
- The new port forwarding offered by `podman machine` requires [gvproxy](https://github.com/containers/gvisor-tap-vsock) in order to function.
- Podman will now automatically create the default CNI network if it does not exist, for both root and rootless users. This will only be done once per user - if the network is subsequently removed, it will not be recreated.
- The `install.cni` makefile option has been removed. It is no longer required to distribute the default `87-podman.conflist` CNI configuration file, as Podman will now automatically create it.
- The `--root` option to Podman will not automatically clear all default storage options when set. Storage options can be set manually using `--storage-opt` ([#10393](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10393)).
- The output of `podman system connection list` is now deterministic, with connections being sorted alpabetically by their name.
- The auto-update service (`podman-auto-update.service`) has had its default timer adjusted so it now starts at a random time up to 15 minutes after midnight, to help prevent system congestion from numerous daily services run at once.
- Systemd unit files generated by `podman generate systemd` now depend on `network-online.target` by default ([#10655](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10655)).
- Systemd unit files generated by `podman generate systemd` now use `Type=notify` by default, instead of using PID files.
- The `podman info` command's logic for detecting package versions on Gentoo has been improved, and should be significantly faster.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command did not perform SELinux relabelling of volumes specified with a `mountPath` that included the `:z` or `:Z` options ([#9371](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9371)).

- Fixed a bug where exec sessions in containers were sometimes not cleaned up when run without `-d` and when the associated `podman exec` process was killed before completion.
- Fixed a bug where `podman system service` could, when run in a systemd unit file with sdnotify in use, drop some connections when it was starting up.
- Fixed a bug where containers run using the REST API using the `slirp4netns` network mode would leave zombie processes that were not cleaned up until `podman system service` exited ([#9777](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9777)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman system service` command would leave zombie processes after its initial launch that were not cleaned up until it exited ([#10575](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10575)).

- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command would only respect `.containerignore` and not `.dockerignore` files (when both are present, `.containerignore` will be preferred) ([#10907](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10907)).
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command would fail to send the Dockerfile being built to the server when it was excluded by the `.dockerignore` file, resulting in an error ([#9867](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9867)).
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command could unexpectedly stop streaming the output of the build ([#10154](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10154)).

- Fixed a bug where operations that pruned images (`podman image prune` and `podman system prune`) would prune untagged images with children ([#10832](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10832)).
- Fixed a bug where dual-stack networks created by `podman network create` did not properly auto-assign an IPv4 subnet when one was not explicitly specified ([#11032](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11032)).
- Fixed a bug where port forwarding using the `rootlessport` port forwarder would break when a network was disconnected and then reconnected ([#10052](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10052)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would ignore user-specified SELinux policies for containers using the Kata OCI runtime, or containers using systemd as PID 1 ([#11100](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11100)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman containers created using `--net=host` would add an entry to `/etc/hosts` for the container's hostname pointing to `127.0.1.1` ([#10319](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10319)).

- Fixed a bug where the Libpod Stats endpoint for Containers would not error when run on rootless containers on cgroups v1 systems (nonsensical results would be returned, as this configuration cannot be supportable).
- Fixed a bug where the Compat List endpoint for Images omitted the `ContainerConfig` field ([#10795](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10795)).
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Build endpoint for Images was too strict when validating the `Content-Type` header, rejecting content that Docker would have accepted ([#11022](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11012)).

### Misc
- Updated Buildah to v1.22.3
- Updated the containers/storage library to v1.34.1
- Updated the containers/image library to v5.15.2
- Updated the containers/common library to v0.42.1

## 3.2.3
### Security
- This release addresses CVE-2021-3602, an issue with the `podman build` command with the `--isolation chroot` flag that results in environment variables from the host leaking into build containers.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where events related to images could occur before the relevant operation had completed (e.g. an image pull event could be written before the pull was finished) ([#10812](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10812)).
- Fixed a bug where `podman save` would refuse to save images with an architecture different from that of the host ([#10835](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10835)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman import` command did not correctly handle images without tags ([#10854](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10854)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman's journald events backend would fail and prevent Podman from running when run on a host with systemd as PID1 but in an environment (e.g. a container) without systemd ([#10863](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10863)).
- Fixed a bug where containers using rootless CNI networking would fail to start when the `dnsname` CNI plugin was in use and the host system's `/etc/resolv.conf` was a symlink ([#10855](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10855) and [#10929](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10929)).
- Fixed a bug where containers using rootless CNI networking could fail to start due to a race in rootless CNI initialization ([#10930](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10930)).

### Misc
- Updated Buildah to v1.21.3
- Updated the containers/common library to v0.38.16

## 3.2.2
### Changes
- Podman's handling of the Architecture field of images has been relaxed. Since 3.2.0, Podman required that the architecture of the image match the architecture of the system to run containers based on an image, but images often incorrectly report architecture, causing Podman to reject valid images ([#10648](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10648) and [#10682](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10682)).
- Podman no longer uses inotify to monitor for changes to CNI configurations. This removes potential issues where Podman cannot be run because a user has exhausted their available inotify sessions ([#10686](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10686)).

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the `podman cp` would, when given a directory as its source and a target that existed and was a file, copy the contents of the directory into the parent directory of the file; this now results in an error.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman logs` command would, when following a running container's logs, not include the last line of output from the container when it exited when the `k8s-file` driver was in use ([#10675](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10675)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to run containers if `systemd-resolved` was incorrectly detected as the system's DNS server ([#10733](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10733)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman exec -t` command would only resize the exec session's TTY after the session started, leading to a race condition where the terminal would initially not have a size set ([#10560](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10560)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman containers using the `slirp4netns` network mode would add an incorrect entry to `/etc/hosts` pointing the container's hostname to the wrong IP address.
- Fixed a bug where Podman would create volumes specified by images with incorrect permissions ([#10188](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10188) and [#10606](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10606)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would not respect the `uid` and `gid` options to `podman volume create -o` ([#10620](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10620)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman run` command could panic when parsing the system's cgroup configuration ([#10666](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10666)).
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build -f - ...` command did not read a Containerfile from STDIN ([#10621](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10621)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman container restore --import` command would fail to restore checkpoints created from privileged containers ([#10615](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10615)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman was not respecting the `TMPDIR` environment variable when pulling images ([#10698](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10698)).
- Fixed a bug where a number of Podman commands did not properly support using Go templates as an argument to the `--format` option.

### API
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Inspect endpoint for Containers did not include information on container healthchecks ([#10457](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10457)).
- Fixed a bug where the Libpod and Compat Build endpoints for Images did not properly handle the `devices` query parameter ([#10614](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10614)).

### Misc
- Fixed a bug where the Makefile's `make podman-remote-static` target to build a statically-linked `podman-remote` binary was instead producing dynamic binaries ([#10656](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10656)).
- Updated the containers/common library to v0.38.11

## 3.2.1
### Changes
- Podman now allows corrupt images (e.g. from restarting the system during an image pull) to be replaced by a `podman pull` of the same image (instead of requiring they be removed first, then re-pulled).

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to start containers if a Seccomp profile was not available at `/usr/share/containers/seccomp.json` ([#10556](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10556)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine start` command failed on OS X machines with the AMD64 architecture and certain QEMU versions ([#10555](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10555)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would always use the slow path for joining the rootless user namespace.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman stats` command would fail on Cgroups v1 systems when run on a container running systemd ([#10602](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10602)).
- Fixed a bug where pre-checkpoint support for `podman container checkpoint` did not function correctly.
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command did not properly handle the `-f` option ([#9871](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9871)).
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman run` command would sometimes not resize the container's terminal before execution began ([#9859](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9859)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--filter` option to the `podman image prune` command was nonfunctional.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman logs -f` command would exit before all output for a container was printed when the `k8s-file` log driver was in use ([#10596](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10596)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would not correctly detect that systemd-resolved was in use on the host and adjust DNS servers in the container appropriately under some circumstances ([#10570](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10570)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman network connect` and `podman network disconnect` commands acted improperly when containers were in the Created state, marking the changes as done but not actually performing them.

### API
- Fixed a bug where the Compat and Libpod Prune endpoints for Networks returned null, instead of an empty array, when nothing was pruned.
- Fixed a bug where the Create API for Images would continue to pull images even if a client closed the connection mid-pull ([#7558](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7558)).
- Fixed a bug where the Events API did not include some information (including labels) when sending events.
- Fixed a bug where the Events API would, when streaming was not requested, send at most one event ([#10529](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10529)).

### Misc
- Updated the containers/common library to v0.38.9

## 3.2.0
### Features
- Docker Compose is now supported with rootless Podman ([#9169](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9169)).
- The `podman network connect`, `podman network disconnect`, and `podman network reload` commands have been enabled for rootless Podman.
- An experimental new set of commands, `podman machine`, was added to assist in managing virtual machines containing a Podman server. These are intended for easing the use of Podman on OS X by handling the creation of a Linux VM for running Podman.
- The `podman generate kube` command can now be run on Podman named volumes (generating `PersistentVolumeClaim` YAML), in addition to pods and containers.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports two new options, `--ip` and `--mac`, to set static IPs and MAC addresses for created pods ([#8442](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8442) and [#9731](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9731)).
- The `podman play kube` command's support for `PersistentVolumeClaim` YAML has been greatly improved.
- The `podman generate kube` command now preserves the label used by `podman auto-update` to identify containers to update as a Kubernetes annotation, and the `podman play kube` command will convert this annotation back into a label. This allows `podman auto-update` to be used with containers created by `podman play kube`.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports Kubernetes `secretRef` YAML (using the secrets support from `podman secret`) for environment variables.
- Secrets can now be added to containers as environment variables using the `type=env` option to the `--secret` flag to `podman create` and `podman run`.
- The `podman start` command now supports the `--all` option, allowing all containers to be started simultaneously with a single command. The `--filter` option has also been added to filter which containers to start when `--all` is used.
- Filtering containers with the `--filter` option to `podman ps` and `podman start` now supports a new filter, `restart-policy`, to filter containers based on their restart policy.
- The `--group-add` option to rootless `podman run` and `podman create` now accepts a new value, `keep-groups`, which instructs Podman to retain the supplemental groups of the user running Podman in the created container. This is only supported with the `crun` OCI runtime.
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a new option, `--timeout`. This sets a maximum time the container is allowed to run, after which it is killed ([#6412](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6412)).
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a new option, `--pidfile`. This will create a file when the container is started containing the PID of the first process in the container.
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a new option, `--requires`. The `--requires` option adds dependency containers - containers that must be running before the current container. Commands like `podman start` will automatically start the requirements of a container before starting the container itself.
- Auto-updating containers can now be done with locally-built images, not just images hosted on a registry, by creating containers with the `io.containers.autoupdate` label set to `local`.
- Podman now supports the [Container Device Interface](https://github.com/container-orchestrated-devices/container-device-interface) (CDI) standard.
- Podman now adds an entry to `/etc/hosts`, `host.containers.internal`, pointing to the current gateway (which, for root containers, is usually a bridge interface on the host system) ([#5651](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/5651)).
- The `podman ps`, `podman pod ps`, `podman network list`, `podman secret list`, and `podman volume list` commands now support a `--noheading` option, which will cause Podman to omit the heading line including column names.
- The `podman unshare` command now supports a new flag, `--rootless-cni`, to join the rootless network namespace. This allows commands to be run in the same network environment as rootless containers with CNI networking.
- The `--security-opt unmask=` option to `podman run` and `podman create` now supports glob operations to unmask a group of paths at once (e.g. `podman run --security-opt unmask=/proc/* ...` will unmask all paths in `/proc` in the container).
- The `podman network prune` command now supports a `--filter` option to filter which networks will be pruned.

### Changes
- The change in Podman 3.1.2 where the `:z` and `:Z` mount options for volumes were ignored for privileged containers has been reverted after discussion in [#10209](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10209).
- Podman's rootless CNI functionality no longer requires a sidecar container! The removal of the requirement for the `rootless-cni-infra` container means that rootless CNI is now usable on all architectures, not just AMD64, and no longer requires pulling an image ([#8709](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8709)).
- The Image handling code used by Podman has seen a major rewrite to improve code sharing with our other projects, Buildah and CRI-O. This should result in fewer bugs and performance gains in the long term. Work on this is still ongoing.
- The `podman auto-update` command now prunes previous versions of images after updating if they are unused, to prevent disk exhaustion after repeated updates ([#10190](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10190)).
- The `podman play kube` now treats environment variables configured as references to a `ConfigMap` as mandatory unless the `optional` parameter was set; this better matches the behavior of Kubernetes.
- Podman now supports the `--context=default` flag from Docker as a no-op for compatibility purposes.
- When Podman is run as root, but without `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` being available, it will run in a user namespace using the same code as rootless Podman (instead of failing outright).
- The `podman info` command now includes the path of the Seccomp profile Podman is using, available cgroup controllers, and whether Podman is connected to a remote service or running containers locally.
- Containers created with the `--rm` option now automatically use the `volatile` storage flag when available for their root filesystems, causing them not to write changes to disk as often as they will be removed at completion anyways. This should result in improved performance.
- The `podman generate systemd --new` command will now include environment variables referenced by the container in generated unit files if the value would be looked up from the system environment.
- Podman now requires that Conmon v2.0.24 be available.

- Fixed a bug where the `IMAGE` and `NAME` variables in `podman container runlabel` were not being correctly substituted ([#10192](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10192)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman could freeze when creating containers with a specific combination of volumes and working directory ([#10216](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10216)).
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman containers restarted by restart policy (e.g. containers created with `--restart=always`) would lose networking after being restarted ([#8047](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8047)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman cp` command could not copy files into containers created with the `--pid=host` flag ([#9985](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9985)).
- Fixed a bug where filters to the `podman events` command could not be specified twice (if a filter is specified more than once, it will match if any of the given values match - logical or) ([#10507](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10507)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would include IPv6 nameservers in `resolv.conf` in containers without IPv6 connectivity ([#10158](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10158)).
- Fixed a bug where containers could not be created with static IP addresses when connecting to a network using the `macvlan` driver ([#10283](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10283)).

### Misc
- Updated the containers/image library to v5.11.1

## 3.1.1
### Changes

## 3.1.0
### Features
- A set of new commands has been added to manage secrets! The `podman secret create`, `podman secret inspect`, `podman secret ls` and `podman secret rm` commands have been added to handle secrets, along with the `--secret` option to `podman run` and `podman create` to add secrets to containers. The initial driver for secrets does not support encryption - this will be added in a future release.
- A new command to prune networks, `podman network prune`, has been added ([#8673](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8673)).
- The `-v` option to `podman run` and `podman create` now supports a new volume option, `:U`, to chown the volume's source directory on the host to match the UID and GID of the container and prevent permissions issues ([#7778](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7778)).
- Three new commands, `podman network exists`, `podman volume exists`, and `podman manifest exists`, have been added to check for the existence of networks, volumes, and manifest lists.
- The `podman cp` command can now copy files into directories mounted as `tmpfs` in a running container.
- The `podman volume prune` command will now list volumes that will be pruned when prompting the user whether to continue and perform the prune ([#8913](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8913)).
- The Podman remote client's `podman build` command now supports the `--disable-compression`, `--excludes`, and `--jobs` options.
- The Podman remote client's `podman push` command now supports the `--format` option.
- The Podman remote client's `podman rm` command now supports the `--all` and `--ignore` options.
- The Podman remote client's `podman search` command now supports the `--no-trunc` and `--list-tags` options.
- The `podman play kube` command can now read in Kubernetes YAML from `STDIN` when `-` is specified as file name (`podman play kube -`), allowing input to be piped into the command for scripting ([#8996](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8996)).
- The `podman generate systemd` command now supports a `--no-header` option, which disables creation of the header comment automatically added by Podman to generated unit files.
- The `podman generate kube` command can now generate `PersistentVolumeClaim` YAML for Podman named volumes ([#5788](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/5788)).
- The `podman generate kube` command can now generate YAML files containing multiple resources (pods or deployments) ([#9129](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9129)).

### Security
- This release resolves CVE-2021-20291, a deadlock vulnerability in the storage library caused by pulling a specially-crafted container image.

### Changes
- The Podman remote client's `podman build` command no longer allows the `-v` flag to be used. Volumes are not yet supported with remote Podman when the client and service are on different machines.
- The `podman kill` and `podman stop` commands now print the name given by the user for each container, instead of the full ID.
- When the `--security-opt unmask=ALL` or `--security-opt unmask=/sys/fs/cgroup` options to `podman create` or `podman run` are given, Podman will mount cgroups into the container as read-write, instead of read-only ([#8441](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8441)).
- The `podman rmi` command has been changed to better handle cases where an image is incomplete or corrupted, which can be caused by interrupted image pulls.
- The `podman rename` command has been improved to be more atomic, eliminating many race conditions that could potentially render a renamed container unusable.
- Detection of which OCI runtimes run using virtual machines and thus require custom SELinux labelling has been improved ([#9582](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9582)).
- The hidden `--trace` option to `podman` has been turned into a no-op. It was used in very early versions for performance tracing, but has not been supported for some time.
- The `podman generate systemd` command now generates `RequiresMountsFor` lines to ensure necessary storage directories are mounted before systemd starts Podman.
- Podman will now emit a warning when `--tty` and `--interactive` are both passed, but `STDIN` is not a TTY. This will be made into an error in the next major Podman release some time next year.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman containers joined to CNI networks could not receive traffic from forwarded ports ([#9065](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9065)).
- Fixed a bug where `podman network create` with the `--macvlan` flag did not honor the `--gateway`, `--subnet`, and `--opt` options ([#9167](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9167)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate kube` command generated invalid YAML for privileged containers ([#8897](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8897)).

- Foxed a bug where Podman did not respect the `no_hosts` default in `containers.conf` when creating containers.
- Fixed a bug where the `--tail=0`, `--since`, and `--follow` options to the `podman logs` command did not function properly when using the `journald` log backend.
- Fixed a bug where specifying more than one container to `podman logs` when the `journald` log backend was in use did not function correctly.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman run` and `podman create` commands would panic if a memory limit was set, but the swap limit was set to unlimited ([#9429](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9429)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--network` option to `podman run`, `podman create`, and `podman pod create` would error if the user attempted to specify CNI networks by ID, instead of name ([#9451](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9451)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman's cgroup handling for cgroups v1 systems did not properly handle cases where a cgroup existed on some, but not all, controllers, resulting in errors from the `podman stats` command ([#9252](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9252)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman cp` did not properly handle cases where `/dev/stdout` was specified as the destination (it was treated identically to `-`) ([#9362](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9362)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman cp` command would create files with incorrect ownership ([#9526](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9626)).

- Fixed a bug where the `podman cp` command did not properly evaluate symlinks when copying out of containers.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman rm -fa` command would error when attempting to remove containers created with `--rm` ([#9479](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9479)).
- Fixed a bug where the ordering of capabilities was nondeterministic in the `CapDrop` field of the output of `podman inspect` on a container ([#9490](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9490)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman network connect` command could be used with containers that were not initially connected to a CNI bridge network (e.g. containers created with `--net=host`) ([#9496](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9496)).
- Fixed a bug where DNS search domains required by the `dnsname` CNI plugin were not being added to container's `resolv.conf` under some circumstances.
- Fixed a bug where the `--ignorefile` option to `podman build` was nonfunctional ([#9570](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9570)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--timestamp` option to `podman build` was nonfunctional ([#9569](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9569)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--iidfile` option to `podman build` could cause Podman to panic if an error occurred during the build.
- Fixed a bug where the `--dns-search` option to `podman build` was nonfunctional ([#9574](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9574)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--pull-never` option to `podman build` was nonfunctional ([#9573](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9573)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--build-arg` option to `podman build` would, when given a key but not a value, error (instead of attempting to look up the key as an environment variable) ([#9571](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9571)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--isolation` option to `podman build` in the remote Podman client was nonfunctional.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman network disconnect` command could cause errors when the container that had a network removed was stopped and its network was cleaned up ([#9602](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9602)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman network rm` command did not properly check what networks a container was present in, resulting in unexpected behavior if `podman network connect` or `podman network disconnect` had been used with the network ([#9632](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9632)).
- Fixed a bug where some errors with stopping a container could cause Podman to panic, and the container to be stuck in an unusable `stopping` state ([#9615](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9615)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman load` command could return 0 even in cases where an error occurred ([#9672](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9672)).
- Fixed a bug where specifying storage options to Podman using the `--storage-opt` option would override all storage options. Instead, storage options are now overridden only when the `--storage-driver` option is used to override the current graph driver ([#9657](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9657)).
- Fixed a bug where containers created with `--privileged` could request more capabilities than were available to Podman.
- Fixed a bug where `podman commit` did not use the `TMPDIR` environment variable to place temporary files created during the commit ([#9825](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9825)).
- Fixed a bug where remote Podman could error when attempting to resize short-lived containers ([#9831](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9831)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman was unusable on kernels built without `CONFIG_USER_NS`.
- Fixed a bug where the ownership of volumes created by `podman volume create` and then mounted into a container could be incorrect ([#9608](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9608)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman volumes using a volume plugin could not pass certain options, and could not be used as non-root users.
- Fixed a bug where the `--tz` option to `podman create` and `podman run` did not properly validate its input.

### API
- Fixed a bug where the `X-Registry-Auth` header did not accept `null` as a valid value.
- A new compat endpoint, `/auth`, has been added. This endpoint validates credentials against a registry ([#9564](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9564)).
- Fixed a bug where the compat Build endpoint for Images specified labels using the wrong type (array vs map). Both formats will be accepted now.
- Fixed a bug where the compat Build endpoint for Images did not report that it successfully tagged the built image in its response.
- Fixed a bug where the compat Create endpoint for Images did not provide progress information on pulling the image in its response.
- Fixed a bug where the compat Push endpoint for Images did not properly handle the destination (used a query parameter, instead of a path parameter).
- Fixed a bug where the compat Push endpoint for Images did not send the progress of the push and the digest of the pushed image in the response body.
- Fixed a bug where the compat List endpoint for Networks returned null, instead of an empty array (`[]`), when no networks were present ([#9293](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9293)).
- Fixed a bug where the compat List endpoint for Networks returned nulls, instead of empty maps, for networks that do not have Labels and/or Options.
- The Libpod Inspect endpoint for networks (`/libpod/network/$ID/json`) now has an alias at `/libpod/network/$ID` ([#9691](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9691)).
- Fixed a bug where the libpod Inspect endpoint for Networks returned a 1-size array of results, instead of a single result ([#9690](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9690)).
- The Compat List endpoint for Networks now supports the legacy format for filters in parallel with the current filter format ([#9526](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9526)).

## 3.0.1
### Changes
- Several frequently-occurring `WARN` level log messages have been downgraded to `INFO` or `DEBUG` to not clutter terminal output.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the `Created` field of `podman ps --format=json` was formatted as a string instead of an Unix timestamp (integer) ([#9315](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9315)).
- Fixed a bug where failing lookups of individual layers during the `podman images` command would cause the whole command to fail without printing output.
- Fixed a bug where `--cgroups=split` did not function properly on cgroups v1 systems.
- Fixed a bug where mounting a volume over an directory in the container that existed, but was empty, could fail ([#9393](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9393)).
- Fixed a bug where mounting a volume over a directory in the container that existed could copy the entirety of the container's rootfs, instead of just the directory mounted over, into the volume ([#9415](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/9415)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would treat the `--entrypoint=[""]` option to `podman run` and `podman create` as a literal empty string in the entrypoint, when instead it should have been ignored ([#9377](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9377)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would set the `HOME` environment variable to `""` when the container ran as a user without an assigned home directory ([#9378](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9378)).
- Fixed a bug where specifying a pod infra image that had no tags (by using its ID) would cause `podman pod create` to panic ([#9374](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9374)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--runtime` option was not properly handled by the `podman build` command ([#9365](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9365)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would incorrectly print an error message related to the remote API when the remote API was not in use and starting Podman failed.
- Fixed a bug where Podman would change ownership of a container's working directory, even if it already existed ([#9387](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9387)).

- The Compat Create endpoint for Images has had its compatibility with Docker improved, allowing its use with the `docker-java` library.

### Misc
- Updated Buildah to v1.19.4
- Updated the containers/storage library to v1.24.6

## 3.0.0
### Features
- Podman now features initial support for Docker Compose.
- Added the `podman rename` command, which allows containers to be renamed after they are created ([#1925](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/1925)).
- The Podman remote client now supports the `podman copy` command.
- A new command, `podman network reload`, has been added. This command will re-configure the network of all running containers, and can be used to recreate firewall rules lost when the system firewall was reloaded (e.g. via `firewall-cmd --reload`).
- Podman networks now have IDs. They can be seen in `podman network ls` and can be used when removing and inspecting networks. Existing networks receive IDs automatically.
- Podman networks now also support labels. They can be added via the `--label` option to `network create`, and `podman network ls` can filter labels based on them.
- The `podman network create` command now supports setting bridge MTU and VLAN through the `--opt` option ([#8454](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8454)).
- The `podman container checkpoint` and `podman container restore` commands can now checkpoint and restore containers that include volumes.
- The `podman container checkpoint` command now supports the `--with-previous` and `--pre-checkpoint` options, and the `podman container restore` command now support the `--import-previous` option. These add support for two-step checkpointing with lowered dump times.
- The `podman push` command can now push manifest lists. Podman will first attempt to push as an image, then fall back to pushing as a manifest list if that fails.
- The `podman generate kube` command can now be run on multiple containers at once, and will generate a single pod containing all of them.
- The `podman generate kube` and `podman play kube` commands now support Kubernetes DNS configuration, and will preserve custom DNS configuration when exporting or importing YAML ([#9132](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9132)).
- The `podman generate kube` command now properly supports generating YAML for containers and pods creating using host networking (`--net=host`) ([#9077](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9077)).
- The `podman kill` command now supports a `--cidfile` option to kill containers given a file containing the container's ID ([#8443](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8443)).
- The `podman pod create` command now supports the `--net=none` option ([#9165](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9165)).
- The `podman volume create` command can now specify volume UID and GID as options with the `UID` and `GID` fields passed to the the `--opt` option.
- Initial support has been added for Docker Volume Plugins. Podman can now define available plugins in `containers.conf` and use them to create volumes with `podman volume create --driver`.
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a new option, `--platform`, to specify the platform of the image to be used when creating the container.
- The `--security-opt` option to `podman run` and `podman create` now supports the `systempaths=unconfined` option to unrestrict access to all paths in the container, as well as `mask` and `unmask` options to allow more granular restriction of container paths.
- The `podman stats --format` command now supports a new format specified, `MemUsageBytes`, which prints the raw bytes of memory consumed by a container without human-readable formatting [#8945](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8945).
- The `podman ps` command can now filter containers based on what pod they are joined to via the `pod` filter ([#8512](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8512)).
- The `podman pod ps` command can now filter pods based on what networks they are joined to via the `network` filter.
- The `podman pod ps` command can now print information on what networks a pod is joined to via the `.Networks` specifier to the `--format` option.
- The `podman system prune` command now supports filtering what containers, pods, images, and volumes will be pruned.
- The `podman volume prune` commands now supports filtering what volumes will be pruned.
- The `podman system prune` command now includes information on space reclaimed ([#8658](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8658)).
- The `podman info` command will now properly print information about packages in use on Gentoo and Arch systems.
- The `containers.conf` file now contains an option for disabling creation of a new kernel keyring on container creation ([#8384](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8384)).
- The `podman image sign` command can now sign multi-arch images by producing a signature for each image in a given manifest list.
- The `podman image sign` command, when run as rootless, now supports per-user registry configuration files in `$HOME/.config/containers/registries.d`.
- Configuration options for `slirp4netns` can now be set system-wide via the `NetworkCmdOptions` configuration option in `containers.conf`.
- The MTU of `slirp4netns` can now be configured via the `mtu=` network command option (e.g. `podman run --net slirp4netns:mtu=9000`).

### Security
- A fix for CVE-2021-20199 is included. Podman between v1.8.0 and v2.2.1 used `127.0.0.1` as the source address for all traffic forwarded into rootless containers by a forwarded port; this has been changed to address the issue.

### Changes
- Shortname aliasing support has now been turned on by default. All Podman commands that must pull an image will, if a TTY is available, prompt the user about what image to pull.
- The `podman load` command no longer accepts a `NAME[:TAG]` argument. The presence of this argument broke CLI compatibility with Docker by making `docker load` commands unusable with Podman ([#7387](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7387)).
- The Go bindings for the HTTP API have been rewritten with a focus on limiting dependency footprint and improving extensibility. Read more [here](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/v3.0/pkg/bindings/README.md).
- The legacy Varlink API has been completely removed from Podman.
- The default log level for Podman has been changed from Error to Warn.
- The `podman network create` command can now create `macvlan` networks using the `--driver macvlan` option for Docker compatibility. The existing `--macvlan` flag has been deprecated and will be removed in Podman 4.0 some time next year.
- The `podman inspect` command has had the `LogPath` and `LogTag` fields moved into the `LogConfig` structure (from the root of the Inspect structure). The maximum size of the log file is also included.
- The `podman generate systemd` command no longer generates unit files using the deprecated `KillMode=none` option ([#8615](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8615)).
- The `podman stop` command now releases the container lock while waiting for it to stop - as such, commands like `podman ps` will no longer block until `podman stop` completes ([#8501](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8501)).
- Networks created with `podman network create --internal` no longer use the `dnsname` plugin. This configuration never functioned as expected.
- Error messages for the remote Podman client have been improved when it cannot connect to a Podman service.
- Error messages for `podman run` when an invalid SELinux is specified have been improved.
- Rootless Podman features improved support for containers with a single user mapped into the rootless user namespace.
- Pod infra containers now respect default sysctls specified in `containers.conf` allowing for advanced configuration of the namespaces they will share.
- SSH public key handling for remote Podman has been improved.

- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd` command would generate invalid unit files if the container was creating using a command line that included doubled braces (`{{` and `}}`), e.g. `--log-opt-tag={{.Name}}` ([#9034](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9034)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command could generate unit files including invalid Podman commands if the container was created using merged short options (e.g. `podman run -dt`) ([#8847](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8847)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command could generate unit files that did not handle Podman commands including some special characters (e.g. `$`) ([#9176](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9176)
- Fixed a bug where rootless containers joining CNI networks could not set a static IP address ([#7842](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7842)).
- Fixed a bug where rootless containers joining CNI networks could not set network aliases ([#8567](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8567)).
- Fixed a bug where the remote client could, under some circumstances, not include the `Containerfile` when sending build context to the server ([#8374](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8374)).
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman did not mount `/sys` as a new `sysfs` in some circumstances where it was acceptable.
- Fixed a bug where rootless containers that both joined a user namespace and a CNI networks would cause a segfault. These options are incompatible and now return an error.

- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command would always pull images when the `:latest` tag was specified, even if the image was available locally ([#7838](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7838)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command did not properly handle SELinux configuration, rending YAML with custom SELinux configuration unusable ([#8710](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8710)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate kube` command incorrectly populated the `args` and `command` fields of generated YAML ([#9211](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9211)).

- Fixed a bug where user-specified `HOSTNAME` environment variables were overwritten by Podman ([#8886](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8886)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would applied default sysctls from `containers.conf` in too many situations (e.g. applying network sysctls when the container shared its network with a pod).
- Fixed a bug where Podman did not properly handle cases where a secondary image store was in use and an image was present in both the secondary and primary stores ([#8176](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8176)).
- Fixed a bug where systemd-managed rootless Podman containers where the user in the container was not root could fail as the container's PID file was not accessible to systemd on the host ([#8506](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8506)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--privileged` option to `podman run` and `podman create` would, under some circumstances, not disable Seccomp ([#8849](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8849)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman exec` command did not properly add capabilities when the container or exec session were run with `--privileged`.
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would use the `--enable-sandbox` option to `slirp4netns` unconditionally, even when `pivot_root` was disabled, rendering `slirp4netns` unusable when `pivot_root` was disabled ([#8846](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8846)).
- Fixed a bug where `podman build --logfile` did not actually write the build's log to the logfile.

### Misc
- Updated Buildah to v1.19.2
- Updated the containers/storage library to v1.24.5
- Updated the containers/image library to v5.10.2
- Updated the containers/common library to v0.33.4

## v2.2.1
### Changes
- Due to a conflict with a previously-removed field, we were forced to modify the way image volumes (mounting images into containers using `--mount type=image`) were handled in the database. As a result, containers created in Podman 2.2.0 with image volumes will not have them in v2.2.1, and these containers will need to be re-created.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would, on systems without the `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` environment variable defined, use an incorrect path for the PID file of the Podman pause process, causing Podman to fail to start ([#8539](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8539)).
- Fixed a bug where containers created using Podman v1.7 and earlier were unusable in Podman due to JSON decode errors ([#8613](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8613)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman could retrieve invalid cgroup paths, instead of erroring, for containers that were not running.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman system reset` command would print a warning about a duplicate shutdown handler being registered.
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would attempt to mount `sysfs` in circumstances where it was not allowed; some OCI runtimes (notably `crun`) would fall back to alternatives and not fail, but others (notably `runc`) would fail to run containers.
- Fixed a bug where the `podman run` and `podman create` commands would fail to create containers from untagged images ([#8558](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8558)).
- Fixed a bug where remote Podman would prompt for a password even when the server did not support password authentication ([#8498](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8498)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman exec` command did not move the Conmon process for the exec session into the correct cgroup.
- Fixed a bug where shell completion for the `ancestor` option to `podman ps --filter` did not work correctly.
- Fixed a bug where detached containers would not properly clean themselves up (or remove themselves if `--rm` was set) if the Podman command that created them was invoked with `--log-level=debug`.

### API
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not properly handle the `Binds` and `Mounts` parameters in `HostConfig`.
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers ignored the `Name` query parameter.
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not properly handle the "default" value for `NetworkMode` (this value is used extensively by `docker-compose`) ([#8544](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8544)).
- Fixed a bug where the Compat Build endpoint for Images would sometimes incorrectly use the `target` query parameter as the image's tag.

### Misc
- Podman v2.2.0 vendored a non-released, custom version of the `github.com/spf13/cobra` package; this has been reverted to the latest upstream release to aid in packaging.
- Updated the containers/image library to v5.9.0

## 2.2.0
### Features
- Experimental support for shortname aliasing has been added. This is not enabled by default, but can be turned on by setting the environment variable `CONTAINERS_SHORT_NAME_ALIASING` to `on`. Documentation is [available here](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/containers-registries.conf.5.md#short-name-aliasing).
- Initial support has been added for the `podman network connect` and `podman network disconnect` commands, which allow existing containers to modify what networks they are connected to. At present, these commands can only be used on running containers that did not specify `--network=none` when they were created.
- The `podman run` command now supports the `--network-alias` option to set network aliases (additional names the container can be accessed at from other containers via DNS if the `dnsname` CNI plugin is in use). Aliases can also be added and removed using the new `podman network connect` and `podman network disconnect` commands. Please note that this requires a new release (v1.1.0) of the `dnsname` plugin, and will only work on newly-created CNI networks.
- The `podman generate kube` command now features support for exporting container's memory and CPU limits ([#7855](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7855)).
- The `podman play kube` command now features support for setting CPU and Memory limits for containers ([#7742](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7742)).
- The `podman play kube` command now supports persistent volumes claims using Podman named volumes.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports Kubernetes configmaps via the `--configmap` option ([#7567](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7567)).
- The `podman play kube` command now supports a `--log-driver` option to set the log driver for created containers.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports a `--start` option, enabled by default, to start the pod after creating it. This allows for `podman play kube` to be more easily used in systemd unitfiles.
- The `podman network create` command now supports the `--ipv6` option to enable dual-stack IPv6 networking for created networks ([#7302](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7302)).
- The `podman inspect` command can now inspect pods, networks, and volumes, in addition to containers and images ([#6757](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6757)).
- The `--mount` option for `podman run` and `podman create` now supports a new type, `image`, to mount the contents of an image into the container at a given location.
- The Bash and ZSH completions have been completely reworked and have received significant enhancements! Additionally, support for Fish completions and completions for the `podman-remote` executable have been added.
- The `--log-opt` option for `podman create` and `podman run` now supports the `max-size` option to set the maximum size for a container's logs ([#7434](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7434)).
- The `--network` option to the `podman pod create` command now allows pods to be configured to use `slirp4netns` networking, even when run as root ([#6097](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6097)).
- The `podman pod stop`, `podman pod pause`, `podman pod unpause`, and `podman pod kill` commands now work on multiple containers in parallel and should be significantly faster.
- The `podman search` command now supports a `--list-tags` option to list all available tags for a single image in a single repository.
- The `podman search` command can now output JSON using the `--format=json` option.
- The `podman diff` and `podman mount` commands now work with all containers in the storage library, including those not created by Podman. This allows them to be used with Buildah and CRI-O containers.
- The `podman container exists` command now features a `--external` option to check if a container exists not just in Podman, but also in the storage library. This will allow Podman to identify Buildah and CRI-O containers.
- The `--tls-verify` and `--authfile` options have been enabled for use with remote Podman.
- The `/etc/hosts` file now includes the container's name and hostname (both pointing to localhost) when the container is run with `--net=none` ([#8095](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8095)).
- The `podman events` command now supports filtering events based on the labels of the container they occurred on using the `--filter label=key=value` option.
- The `podman volume ls` command now supports filtering volumes based on their labels using the `--filter label=key=value` option.
- The `--volume` and `--mount` options to `podman run` and `podman create` now support two new mount propagation options, `unbindable` and `runbindable`.
- The `name` and `id` filters for `podman pod ps` now match based on a regular expression, instead of requiring an exact match.
- The `podman pod ps` command now supports a new filter `status`, that matches pods in a certain state.

### Changes
- The `podman network rm --force` command will now also remove pods that are using the network ([#7791](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7791)).
- The `podman volume rm`, `podman network rm`, and `podman pod rm` commands now return exit code 1 if the object specified for removal does not exist, and exit code 2 if the object is in use and the `--force` option was not given.
- If `/dev/fuse` is passed into Podman containers as a device, Podman will open it before starting the container to ensure that the kernel module is loaded on the host and the device is usable in the container.
- Global Podman options that were not supported with remote operation have been removed from `podman-remote` (e.g. `--cgroup-manager`, `--storage-driver`).
- Many errors have been changed to remove repetition and be more clear as to what has gone wrong.
- The `--storage` option to `podman rm` is now enabled by default, with slightly changed semantics. If the given container does not exist in Podman but does exist in the storage library, it will be removed even without the `--storage` option. If the container exists in Podman it will be removed normally. The `--storage` option for `podman rm` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
- The `--storage` option to `podman ps` has been renamed to `--external`. An alias has been added so the old form of the option will continue to work.
- Podman now delays the SIGTERM and SIGINT signals during container creation to ensure that Podman is not stopped midway through creating a container resulting in potential resource leakage ([#7941](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7941)).
- The `podman save` command now strips signatures from images it is exporting, as the formats we export to do not support signatures ([#7659](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7659)).
- A new `Degraded` state has been added to pods. Pods that have some, but not all, of their containers running are now considered to be `Degraded` instead of `Running`.
- Podman will now print a warning when conflicting network options related to port forwarding (e.g. `--publish` and `--net=host`) are specified when creating a container.
- The `--restart on-failure` and `--rm` options for containers no longer conflict. When both are specified, the container will be restarted if it exits with a non-zero error code, and removed if it exits cleanly ([#7906](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7906)).
- Remote Podman will no longer use settings from the client's `containers.conf`; defaults will instead be provided by the server's `containers.conf` ([#7657](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7657)).
- The `podman network rm` command now has a new alias, `podman network remove` ([#8402](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8402)).

- Fixed a bug where the `--format "table {{ .Field }}"` option to numerous Podman commands ceased to function on Podman v2.0 and up.
- Fixed a bug where pods did not properly share an SELinux label between their containers, resulting in containers being unable to see the processes of other containers when the pod shared a PID namespace ([#7886](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7886)).

- Fixed a bug where the `podman network create` and `podman network remove` commands could race when run in parallel, with unpredictable results ([#7807](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7807)).
- Fixed a bug where the `-p` option to `podman run`, `podman create`, and `podman pod create` would, when given only a single number (e.g. `-p 80`), assign the same port for both host and container, instead of generating a random host port ([#7947](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7947)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman containers did not properly store the cgroup manager they were created with, causing them to stop functioning after the cgroup manager was changed in `containers.conf` or with the `--cgroup-manager` option ([#7830](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7830)).

- Fixed a bug where the `podman run` and `podman start --attach` commands would exit with an error when the user detached manually using the detach keys on remote Podman ([#7979](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7979)).
- Fixed a bug where rootless CNI networking did not use the `dnsname` CNI plugin if it was not available on the host, despite it always being available in the container used for rootless networking ([#8040](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8040)).
- Fixed a bug where Podman did not properly handle cases where an OCI runtime is specified by its full path, and could revert to using another OCI runtime with the same binary path that existed in the system `$PATH` on subsequent invocations.
- Fixed a bug where the `--net=host` option to `podman create` and `podman run` would cause the `/etc/hosts` file to be incorrectly populated ([#8054](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8054)).

- Fixed a bug where Podman could not start containers if running on a system without a `/etc/resolv.conf` file (which occurs on some WSL2 images) ([#8089](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8089)).
- Fixed a bug where the `--extract` option to `podman cp` was nonfunctional.
- Fixed a bug where the `--cidfile` option to `podman run` would, when the container was not run with `--detach`, only create the file after the container exited ([#8091](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8091)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman images` and `podman images -a` commands could panic and not list any images when certain improperly-formatted images were present in storage ([#8148](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8148)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman events` command could, when the `journald` events backend was in use, become nonfunctional when a badly-formatted event or a log message that container certain string was present in the journal ([#8125](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8125)).

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where Podman would not build with the `varlink` build tag enabled.

- The Libpod Stats endpoint for containers is being deprecated and will be replaced by a similar endpoint with additional features in a future release.

## 2.1.0
### Features
- A new command, `podman image mount`, has been added. This allows for an image to be mounted, read-only, to inspect its contents without creating a container from it ([#1433](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/1433)).
- The `podman save` and `podman load` commands can now create and load archives containing multiple images ([#2669](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/2669)).
- Rootless Podman now supports all `podman network` commands, and rootless containers can now be joined to networks.
- The performance of `podman build` on `ADD` and `COPY` instructions has been greatly improved, especially when a `.dockerignore` is present.
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a new mode for the `--cgroups` option, `--cgroups=split`. Podman will create two cgroups under the cgroup it was launched in, one for the container and one for Conmon. This mode is useful for running Podman in a systemd unit, as it ensures that all processes are retained in systemd's cgroup hierarchy ([#6400](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6400)).
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands can now specify options to slirp4netns by using the `--network` option as follows:  `--net slirp4netns:opt1,opt2`. This allows for, among other things, switching the port forwarder used by slirp4netns away from rootlessport.
- The `podman ps` command now features a new option, `--storage`, to show containers from Buildah, CRI-O and other applications.
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now feature a `--sdnotify` option to control the behavior of systemd's sdnotify with containers, enabling improved support for Podman in `Type=notify` units.
- The `podman run` command now features a `--preserve-fds` option to pass file descriptors from the host into the container ([#6458](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6458)).
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands can now create overlay volume mounts, by adding the `:O` option to a bind mount (e.g. `-v /test:/test:O`). Overlay volume mounts will mount a directory into a container from the host and allow changes to it, but not write those changes back to the directory on the host.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports the Socket HostPath type ([#7112](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7112)).
- The `podman play kube` command now supports read-only mounts.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports setting labels on pods from Kubernetes metadata labels.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports setting container restart policy ([#7656](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7656)).
- The `podman play kube` command now properly handles `HostAlias` entries.
- The `podman generate kube` command now adds entries to `/etc/hosts` from `--host-add` generated YAML as `HostAlias` entries.
- The `podman play kube` and `podman generate kube` commands now properly support `shareProcessNamespace` to share the PID namespace in pods.
- The `podman volume ls` command now supports the `dangling` filter to identify volumes that are dangling (not attached to any container).
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now feature a `--umask` option to set the umask of the created container.
- The `podman create` and `podman run` commands now feature a `--tz` option to set the timezone within the container ([#5128](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/5128)).
- Environment variables for Podman can now be added in the `containers.conf` configuration file.
- The `--mount` option of `podman run` and `podman create` now supports a new mount type, `type=devpts`, to add a `devpts` mount to the container. This is useful for containers that want to mount `/dev/` from the host into the container, but still create a terminal.
- The `--security-opt` flag to `podman run` and `podman create` now supports a new option, `proc-opts`, to specify options for the container's `/proc` filesystem.
- Podman with the `crun` OCI runtime now supports a new option to `podman run` and `podman create`, `--cgroup-conf`, which allows for advanced configuration of cgroups on cgroups v2 systems.
- The `podman create` and `podman run` commands now support a `--override-variant` option, to override the architecture variant of the image that will be pulled and ran.
- A new global option has been added to Podman, `--runtime-flags`, which allows for setting flags to use when the OCI runtime is called.
- The `podman manifest add` command now supports the `--cert-dir`, `--auth-file`, `--creds`, and `--tls-verify` options.

### Security
- This release resolves CVE-2020-14370, in which environment variables could be leaked between containers created using the Varlink API.

### Changes
- Podman will now retry pulling an image 3 times if a pull fails due to network errors.
- The `podman exec` command would previously print error messages (e.g. `exec session exited with non-zero exit code -1`) when the command run exited with a non-0 exit code. It no longer does this. The `podman exec` command will still exit with the same exit code as the command run in the container did.
- Error messages when creating a container or pod with a name that is already in use have been improved.
- For read-only containers running systemd init, Podman creates a tmpfs filesystem at `/run`. This was previously limited to 65k in size and mounted `noexec`, but is now unlimited size and mounted `exec`.
- The `podman system reset` command no longer removes configuration files for rootless Podman.

### Bugfixes

## 2.0.3
### Features
- The `podman search` command now allows wildcards in search terms.
- The `podman play kube` command now supports the `IfNotPresent` pull type.

### Changes

- Fixed a bug where protocols in port mappings were not recognized unless they were lower-case ([#6948](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6948)).
- Fixed a bug where information on pod infra containers was not included in the output of `podman pod inspect`.
- Fixed a bug where Podman's systemd detection (activated by the enabled-by-default `--systemd=true` flag) would not flag a container for systemd mode if systemd was part of the entrypoint, not the command ([#6920](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6920)).
- Fixed a bug where `podman start --attach` was not defaulting `--sig-proxy` to true ([#6928](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6928)).

### API
- Fixed a bug where the events endpoints (both libpod and compat) could potentially panic on parsing filters.
- Fixed a bug where the compat Create endpoint for containers did not properly handle Entrypoint and Command.
- Fixed a bug where the Logs endpoint for containers (both libpod and compat) would not properly handle client disconnect, resulting in high CPU usage.
- The type of filters on the compat events endpoint has been adjusted to match Docker's implementation ([#6899](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6899)).
- The idle connection counter now properly handles hijacked connections.
- All endpoints that hijack will now properly print headers per RFC 7230 standards.

## 2.0.2
### Changes
- The `podman system connection` command has been temporarily disabled, as it was not functioning as expected.

- Fixed a bug where the `--remote` flag to Podman required an argument, despite being a boolean ([#6704](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/6704)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command could generate incorrect unit files for a pod if a container in the pod was created using the `--pod=...` flag (with an =, instead of a space, before the pod ID) ([#6766](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/6766)).
- Fixed a bug where `NPROC` and `NOFILE` rlimits could be improperly set for rootless Podman containers, causing them to fail to start.
- Fixed a bug where `podman mount` as rootless did not error (the `podman mount` command cannot be run rootless unless it is run inside a `podman unshare` shell).
- Fixed a bug where in some cases a race in events handling code could cause error messages related to retrieving events to be lost.

### API

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where `podman build` did not properly handle the `--http-proxy` and `--cgroup-manager` flags.
- Fixed a bug where error messages related to a missing or inaccessible `/etc/subuid` or `/etc/subgid` file were very unclear ([#6572](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/6572)).
- Fixed a bug where the `podman logs --follow` command would not stop when the container being followed exited.

- Podman previously did not allow the creation of containers with a memory limit lower than 4MB. This restriction has been removed, as the `crun` runtime can create containers with significantly less memory

## 1.6.3
### Features
- Handling of the `libpod.conf` configuration file has seen major changes. Most significantly, rootless users will no longer automatically receive a complete configuration file when they first use Podman, and will instead only receive differences from the global configuration.
- Initial support for the CNI DNS plugin, which allows containers to resolve the IPs of other containers via DNS name, has been added
- Podman now supports anonymous named volumes, created by specifying only a destination to the `-v` flag to the `podman create` and `podman run` commands
- Named volumes now support `uid` and `gid` options in `--opt o=...` to set UID and GID of the created volume

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the `podman start` command would print container ID, instead of name, when starting containers given their name
- Fixed a bug where named volumes with options did not properly detect issues with mounting the volume, leading to an inconsistent state ([#4303](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/4303))

- Fixed a bug where the `podman volume inspect` command would not show the options that named volumes were created with
- Fixed a bug where custom storage configuration was not written to `storage.conf` at time of first creation for rootless Podman ([#2659](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/2659))
- Fixed a bug where remote Podman did not support shell redirection of container output

### Misc
- Updated vendored containers/image library to v5.0
- Initial support for images using manifest lists has been added, though commands for directly interacting with manifests are still missing
- Support for pushing to and pulling from OSTree has been removed due to deprecation in the containers/image library
- Rootless Podman no longer enables linger on systems with systemd as init by default. As such, containers will now be killed when the user who ran them logs out, unless linger is explicitly enabled using [loginctl](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/loginctl.html)
- Podman will now check the version of `conmon` that is in use to ensure it is sufficient

## 1.6.2
### Features
- Added a `--runtime` flag to `podman system migrate` to allow the OCI runtime for all containers to be reset, to ease transition to the `crun` runtime on CGroups V2 systems until `runc` gains full support
- The `podman rm` command can now remove containers in broken states which previously could not be removed
- The `podman info` command, when run without root, now shows information on UID and GID mappings in the rootless user namespace
- Added `podman build --squash-all` flag, which squashes all layers (including those of the base image) into one layer
- The `--systemd` flag to `podman run` and `podman create` now accepts a string argument and allows a new value, `always`, which forces systemd support without checking if the the container entrypoint is systemd

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the `podman top` command did not work on systems using CGroups V2 ([#4192](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/4192))
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could double-close a file, leading to a panic
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could fail to retrieve some containers while refreshing the state
- Fixed a bug where `podman start --attach --sig-proxy=false` would still proxy signals into the container
- Fixed a bug where Podman would unconditionally use a non-default path for authentication credentials (`auth.json`), breaking `podman login` integration with `skopeo` and other tools using the containers/image library
- Fixed a bug where `podman ps --format=json` and `podman images --format=json` would display `null` when no results were returned, instead of valid JSON
- Fixed a bug where `podman build --squash` was incorrectly squashing all layers into one, instead of only new layers
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would allow volumes with options to be mounted (mounting volumes requires root), creating an inconsistent state where volumes reported as mounted but were not ([#4248](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/4248))
- Fixed a bug where volumes which failed to unmount could not be removed ([#4247](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/4247))
- Fixed a bug where Podman incorrectly handled some errors relating to unmounted or missing containers in containers/storage
- Fixed a bug where `podman stats` was broken on systems running CGroups V2 when run rootless ([#4268](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/4268))
- Fixed a bug where the `podman start` command would print the short container ID, instead of the full ID
- Fixed a bug where containers created with an OCI runtime that is no longer available (uninstalled or removed from the config file) would not appear in `podman ps` and could not be removed via `podman rm`
- Fixed a bug where containers restored via `podman container restore --import` would retain the CGroup path of the original container, even if their container ID changed; thus, multiple containers created from the same checkpoint would all share the same CGroup

### Misc
- The default PID limit for containers is now set to 4096. It can be adjusted back to the old default (unlimited) by passing `--pids-limit 0` to `podman create` and `podman run`
- The `podman start --attach` command now automatically attaches `STDIN` if the container was created with `-i`
- The `podman network create` command now validates network names using the same regular expression as container and pod names
- The `--systemd` flag to `podman run` and `podman create` will now only enable systemd mode when the binary being run inside the container is `/sbin/init`, `/usr/sbin/init`, or ends in `systemd` (previously detected any path ending in `init` or `systemd`)
- Updated vendored Buildah to 1.11.3
- Updated vendored containers/storage to 1.13.5

- The `podman volume create` command can now create and mount volumes with options, allowing volumes backed by NFS, tmpfs, and many other filesystems
- Podman can now run containers without CGroups for better integration with systemd by using the `--cgroups=disabled` flag with `podman create` and `podman run`. This is presently only supported with the `crun` OCI runtime
- The `podman volume rm` and `podman volume inspect` commands can now refer to volumes by an unambiguous partial name, in addition to full name (e.g. `podman volume rm myvol` to remove a volume named `myvolume`) ([#3891](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/3891))

- Fixed a bug where Podman would error on numeric GIDs that do not exist in the container's `/etc/group`
- Fixed a bug where containers in pods or created with `--net=container` were not mounting `/etc/resolv.conf` and `/etc/hosts`

### Misc
- `podman build` now defaults the `--force-rm` flag to `true`
- Improved `podman runlabel` support for labels featuring arguments with whitespace
- Containers without a network namespace will now use the host's `resolv.conf`
- The `slirp4netns` network mode can now be used with containers running as root. It may be useful for container-in-container scenarios where the outer container does not have host networking set
- Podman now uses `inotify` to wait for container exit files to be created, instead of polling. If `inotify` cannot be used, Podman will fall back to polling to check if the file has been created
- The `podman logs` command now uses improved short-options handling, allowing its flags to be combined if desired (for example, `podman logs -lf` instead of `podman logs -l -f`)

- Added a field to `podman info` to show if Podman is being run as rootless
- Made a small output format change to `podman images` - image sizes now feature a space between number and unit (e.g. `123 MB` now instead of `123MB`)
- Vendored an updated version of `containers/storage` to fix several bugs reported upstream

## 0.11.1
### Features
- Added `--all` and `--latest` flags to `podman checkpoint` and `podman restore`

- Fixed a bug where container status checks would sometimes leave zombie OCI runtime processes
- Fixed checkpoint and restore code to verify an appropriate version of `criu` is being used
- Fixed a bug where environment variables with no specified value (e.g. `-e FOO`) caused errors (they are now added as empty)

- Fixed a bug where `podman run` with the `--user` flag would fail if the container image did not contain `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/group`

### Misc
- `podman rm`, `podman restart`, `podman kill`, `podman pause`, and `podman unpause` now operate in parallel, greatly improving speed when multiple containers are specified
- `podman create`, `podman run`, and `podman ps` have a number of improvements which should greatly increase their speed
- Greatly improved performance and reduced memory utilization of container status checks, which should improve the speed of most Podman commands

## 0.9.2
### Features
- Added `--interval` flag to `podman wait` to determine the interval between checks for container status
- Added a switch in `libpod.conf` to disable reserving ports for running containers. This lowers the safety of port allocations, but can significantly reduce memory usage.

- Fixed default mounts under /dev remaining if /dev is bind-mounted into the container
- Fixed rootless `podman create` with no command specified throwing an error

### Misc
- Added `podman rm --volumes` flag for compatibility with Docker. As Podman does not presently support named volumes, this does nothing for now, but provides improved compatibility with the Docker command line.
- Improved error messages from `podman pull`

### Compatibility
- Podman is no longer being built by default with support for the Devicemapper storage driver. If you are using this storage driver, you should investigate switching to overlayfs.

## 0.9.1.1
### Bugfixes
- Added support for configuring iptables and firewalld firewalls to allow container traffic. This should resolve numerous issues with network access in containers.

### Note
It is recommended that you restart your system firewall after installing this release to clear any firewall rules created by older Podman versions. If port forwarding to containers does not work, it is recommended that you restart your system.

- Fixed a bug with privileged rootless containers with `--net=host` set
- Fixed a bug where `podman exec --user` would not work with usernames, only numeric IDs
- Fixed a bug where Podman was forwarding both TCP and UDP ports to containers when protocol was not specified
- Fixed issues with Apparmor in rootless containers
- Fixed an issue with database encoding causing some containers created by Podman versions 0.8.1 and below to be unusable.

### Compatibility:
We switched JSON encoding/decoding to a new library for this release to address a compatibility issue introduced by v0.8.2.
However, this may cause issues with containers created in 0.8.2 and 0.8.3 with custom DNS servers.
