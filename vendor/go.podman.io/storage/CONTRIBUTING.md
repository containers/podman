## Becoming a Maintainer

To become a maintainer you must first be nominated by an existing maintainer.
If a majority (>50%) of maintainers agree then the proposal is adopted and
you will be added to the list.

Removing a maintainer requires at least 75% of the remaining maintainers
approval, or if the person requests to be removed then it is automatic.
Normally, a maintainer will only be removed if they are considered to be
inactive for a long period of time or are viewed as disruptive to the community.

The current list of maintainers can be found in the
[MAINTAINERS](MAINTAINERS) file.
