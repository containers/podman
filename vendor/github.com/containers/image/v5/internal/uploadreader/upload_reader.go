// UploadReader is a pass-through reader for use in sending non-trivial data using the net/http
// package (http.NewRequest, http.Post and the like).
//
// The net/http package uses a separate goroutine to upload data to a HTTP connection,
// and it is possible for the server to return a response (typically an error) before consuming
// the full body of the request. In that case http.Client.Do can return with an error while
// the body is still being read â€” regardless of of the cancellation, if any, of http.Request.Context().
//
// As a result, any data used/updated by the io.Reader() provided as the request body may be
// used/updated even after http.Client.Do returns, causing races.
//
// To fix this, UploadReader provides a synchronized Terminate() method, which can block for
// a not-completely-negligible time (for a duration of the underlying Read()), but guarantees that
// after Terminate() returns, the underlying reader is never used any more (unlike calling
// the cancellation callback of context.WithCancel, which returns before any recipients may have
// reacted to the cancellation).

// Terminate waits for in-progress Read calls, if any, to finish, and ensures that after
// this function returns, any Read calls will fail with the provided error, and the underlying
// reader will never be used any more.
