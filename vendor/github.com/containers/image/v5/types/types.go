// ImageTransport is a top-level namespace for ways to to store/load an image.
// It should generally correspond to ImageSource/ImageDestination implementations.

// Note that ImageTransport is based on "ways the users refer to image storage", not necessarily on the underlying physical transport.
// For example, all Docker References would be used within a single "docker" transport, regardless of whether the images are pulled over HTTP or HTTPS
// (or, even, IPv4 or IPv6).
//
// OTOH all images using the same transport should (apart from versions of the image format), be interoperable.
// For example, several different ImageTransport implementations may be based on local filesystem paths,
// but using completely different formats for the contents of that path (a single tar file, a directory containing tarballs, a fully expanded container filesystem, ...)
//
// See also transports.KnownTransports.

// BlobInfoCache records data useful for reusing blobs, or substituting equivalent ones, to avoid unnecessary blob copies.

// It records two kinds of data:
// - Sets of corresponding digest vs. uncompressed digest ("DiffID") pairs:
//   One of the two digests is known to be uncompressed, and a single uncompressed digest may correspond to more than one compressed digest.
//   This allows matching compressed layer blobs to existing local uncompressed layers (to avoid unnecessary download and decompression),
//   or uncompressed layer blobs to existing remote compressed layers (to avoid unnecessary compression and upload)/
//
//   It is allowed to record an (uncompressed digest, the same uncompressed digest) correspondence, to express that the digest is known
//   to be uncompressed (i.e. that a conversion from schema1 does not have to decompress the blob to compute a DiffID value).
//
//   This mapping is primarily maintained in generic copy.Image code, but transports may want to contribute more data points if they independently
//   compress/decompress blobs for their own purposes.
//
// - Known blob locations, managed by individual transports:
//   The transports call RecordKnownLocation when encountering a blob that could possibly be reused (typically in GetBlob/PutBlob/TryReusingBlob),
//   recording transport-specific information that allows the transport to reuse the blob in the future;
//   then, TryReusingBlob implementations can call CandidateLocations to look up previously recorded blob locations that could be reused.
