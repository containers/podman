# Allows specification of how storage is populated when pulling images. This
# option can speed the pulling process of images compressed with format
# zstd:chunked. Containers/storage looks for files within images that are being
# pulled from a container registry that were previously pulled to the host.  It
# can copy or create a hard link to the existing file when it finds them,
# eliminating the need to pull them from the container registry. These options
# can deduplicate pulling of content, disk storage of content and can allow the
# kernel to use less memory when running containers.

# containers/storage supports four keys
#   * enable_partial_images="true" | "false"

#     Tells containers/storage to use hard links rather then create new files in
#     the image, if an identical file already existed in storage.
#   * ostree_repos = ""
#     Tells containers/storage where an ostree repository exists that might have
#     previously pulled content which can be used when attempting to avoid
#     pulling content from the container registry
#   * convert_images = "false" | "true"
#     If set to true, containers/storage will convert images to a

#     of local deduplication and hard linking.  It is an expensive

# range that matches the specified name, and using the length of that range.
# Additional ranges are then assigned, using the ranges which specify the
# lowest host-level IDs first, to the lowest not-yet-mapped in-container ID,
# until all of the entries have been used for maps. This setting overrides the

#     All files/directories get set with 0700 permissions.  The owner has rwx
#     access to the files. No other users on the system can access the files.
#     This setting could be used with networked based homedirs.
#  "shared": it is equivalent to 0755.
#     The owner has rwx access to the files and everyone else can read, access
#     and execute them. This setting is useful for sharing containers storage
#     with other users.  For instance have a storage owned by root but shared
#     to rootless users as an additional store.
#     NOTE:  All files within the image are made readable and executable by any
#     user on the system. Even /etc/shadow within your image is now readable by
#     any user.

#   OCTAL: Users can experiment with other OCTAL Permissions.
#
#  Note: The force_mask Flag is an experimental feature, it could change in the
#  future.  When "force_mask" is set the original permission mask is stored in
#  the "user.containers.override_stat" xattr and the "mount_program" option must
#  be specified. Mount programs like "/usr/bin/fuse-overlayfs" present the
#  extended attribute permissions to processes within containers rather than the
#  "force_mask"  permissions.
