# The containers configuration file specifies all of the available configuration
# command-line options/flags for container engine tools like Podman & Buildah,
# but in a TOML format that can be easily modified and versioned.

# Please refer to containers.conf(5) for details of all configuration options.
# Not all container engines implement all of the options.
# All of the options have hard coded defaults and these options will override
# the built in defaults. Users can then override these options via the command
# line. Container engines will read containers.conf files in up to three
# locations in the following order:
#  1. /usr/share/containers/containers.conf
#  2. /etc/containers/containers.conf
#  3. $HOME/.config/containers/containers.conf (Rootless containers ONLY)
#  Items specified in the latter containers.conf, if they exist, override the
# previous containers.conf settings, or the default settings.
