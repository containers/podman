# Distribution

The Docker toolset to pack, ship, store, and deliver content.

This repository provides the Docker Registry 2.0 implementation
for storing and distributing Docker images. It supersedes the
[docker/docker-registry](https://github.com/docker/docker-registry)
project with a new API design, focused around security and performance.

| **registry**       | An implementation of the [Docker Registry HTTP API V2](docs/spec/api.md) for use with docker 1.6+.                                                                                                  |
| **libraries**      | A rich set of libraries for interacting with distribution components. Please see [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/docker/distribution) for details. **Note**: These libraries are **unstable**. |
| **specifications** | _Distribution_ related specifications are available in [docs/spec](docs/spec)                                                                                                                        |

### How does this integrate with Docker engine?

This project should provide an implementation to a V2 API for use in the [Docker
core project](https://github.com/docker/docker). The API should be embeddable
and simplify the process of securely pulling and pushing content from `docker`
daemons.

### What are the long term goals of the Distribution project?

The _Distribution_ project has the further long term goal of providing a
secure tool chain for distributing content. The specifications, APIs and tools
should be as useful with Docker as they are without.

Our goal is to design a professional grade and extensible content distribution
system that allow users to:

* Enjoy an efficient, secured and reliable way to store, manage, package and
  exchange content
* Hack/roll their own on top of healthy open-source components
* Implement their own home made solution through good specs, and solid
  extensions mechanism.

## More about Registry 2.0

The new registry implementation provides the following benefits:

- faster push and pull
- new, more efficient implementation
- simplified deployment
- pluggable storage backend
- webhook notifications

For information on upcoming functionality, please see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

### Who needs to deploy a registry?

By default, Docker users pull images from Docker's public registry instance.
[Installing Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) gives users this
ability. Users can also push images to a repository on Docker's public registry,
if they have a [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account.

For some users and even companies, this default behavior is sufficient. For
others, it is not.

For example, users with their own software products may want to maintain a
registry for private, company images. Also, you may wish to deploy your own
image repository for images used to test or in continuous integration. For these
use cases and others, [deploying your own registry instance](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/registry/deploying.md)
may be the better choice.

### Migration to Registry 2.0

For those who have previously deployed their own registry based on the Registry
1.0 implementation and wish to deploy a Registry 2.0 while retaining images,
data migration is required. A tool to assist with migration efforts has been
created. For more information see [docker/migrator](https://github.com/docker/migrator).
