# Configuration file for c-for-go, which go-libvirt uses to translate the const
# and type definitions from the C-language sources in the libvirt project into
# Go. This file is used by the c-for-go binary (github.com/xlab/c-for-go), which
# is called when 'go generate' is run. See libvirt.go for the command line used.

PARSER:
    # We can't use environment variables here, but we don't want to process the
    # libvirt version installed in the system folders (if any). Instead we'll
    # rely on our caller to link the libvirt source directory to lv_source/, and
    # run on that code. This isn't ideal, but changes to c-for-go are needed to
    # fix it.
